	abstract = {In collaborative settings, information management becomes even more challenging. In addition to the classic challenge of information management (i.e. information overload), collaboration also introduces social barriers between group members; this entails asymmetric roles, where different stakeholders have different levels of motivation, knowledge, social capital, authority, or time. To successfully manage their information, groups of people need to coordinate their needs and resources. In my thesis, I focus on building interfaces for lowering social burdens to negotiate and communicate the distribution of resources. I develop coordination systems that guide interaction for collaborative information-management tasks. I first introduce a system called Ziva, which supports interdisciplinary teams by coordinating information exchange. Then, I describe TaskLight, which aims to support information management during the help-seeking process. Lastly, I present challenges of coordinating tool preferences and a resulting system called CollaboRanger.},

	abstract = {Real-time online interaction is the norm today. Tabletops and other dedicated interactive surface devices with direct input and tangible interaction can enhance remote collaboration, and open up new interaction scenarios based on mixed physical/virtual components. However, they are only available to a small subset of users, as they usually require identical bespoke hardware for every participant, are complex to setup, and need custom scenario-specific applications. We present SurfaceCast, a software toolkit designed to merge multiple distributed, heterogeneous end-user devices into a single, shared mixed-reality surface. Supported devices include regular desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mixed-reality headsets, as well as projector-camera setups and dedicated interactive tabletop systems. This device-agnostic approach provides a fundamental building block for exploration of a far wider range of usage scenarios than previously feasible, including future clients using our provided API. In this paper, we present various example application scenarios which we enhance through the multi-user and multi-device features of the framework. Our results show that the hardware- and content-agnostic architecture of SurfaceCast can run on a wide variety of devices with sufficient performance and fidelity for real-time interaction.},

	abstract = {The correct and timely creation of systems for coordination of group work depends on the ability to express, analyze, and experiment with protocols for managing multiple work threads. We present an evolution of the Trellis model that provides a formal basis for prototyping the coordination structure of a collaboration system. In Trellis, group interaction protocols are represented separately from the interface processes that use them for coordination. Protocols are interpreted (rather than compiled into applications) so group interactions can be changed as a collaborative task progresses. Changes can be made either by a person editing the protocol specification “on the fly” or by a silent “observation” process that participates in an application solely to  perform behavioral adaptations.Trellis uniquely mixes hypermedia browsing with collaboration support. We term this combination a hyperprogram, and we say that a hyperprogram integrates the description of a collaborative task with the information required for that task. As illustration, we describe a protocol for a moderated meeting and show a Trellis prototype conference tool controlled by this protocol.},

Although studies show that synchronous collaboration can bring multiple benefits, such as enhanced productivity and writing quality, little is known about these writing practices in classrooms and their impact on students' writing. Using a mixed method approach, we conducted an empirical study that explores the different styles of synchronous collaboration in 45 Google Docs documents produced by 82 undergraduate students, and how students' practices affect the specific dimensions of the final text including quality. The results suggest that (a) out of four styles, Divide and Conquer style tended to produce better quality text whereas Main Writer had the lowest quality scores, and that (b) balanced participation and amount of peer editing led to longer texts with higher quality scores for content, evidence, but not organization or mechanics. Given these results, we suggest several design features for collaborative writing systems and propose guidelines for instructional practices.},

We found that human assistance and collaborative behavior varied among different contextual situations. Above that User Experience (UX) factors such as trust and perceived safety have a main influence on the type of front-seat passenger assistance and level of collaboration.

But, their small form-factor may impact the effectiveness of the visual feedback channel often used to help users maintain an awareness of their partner's activities during synchronous collaborative tasks. We investigated how visual and tactile feedback affects collaboration on mobile devices, with emphasis on spatial coordination in a shared workspace. From two user studies, our results highlight different benefits of each feedback channel in collaborative handheld systems. Visual feedback can provide precise spatial information for collaborators, but degrades collaboration when the feedback is occluded, and sometimes can distract the user's attention. Spatial tactile feedback can reduce the overload of information in visual space and gently guides the user's attention to an area of interest. Our results also show that visual and tactile feedback can complement each other, and systems using both feedback channels can support better spatial coordination than systems using only one form of feedback.},

However, supporting the reuse process in complex and dynamic contexts, where future use of information is difficult to predict, is challenging. Collaborative analytics exemplifies such a context. We employed distributed cognition theory to design a collaborative visual analytics system, called AnalyticStream, for facilitating reuse of analysis outcomes. In contrast with the commonly used detail-oriented approach to applying distributed cognition, we performed a high level analysis of the design situation and we identified the cognitive processes that could be distributed over people to facilitate their collaboration. We examined some of the ideas derived from the theoretical analysis, by designing a simple reminding process through recommending relevant pieces of analysis, as well as a mechanism for attention management through allowing users greater control over their shared activity streams. A mixed-methods study of AnalyticStream showed that suggesting relevant artefacts facilitated discovering and consequently reusing them, and provided context-relevant awareness of other analysts' activities.},

WebSplitter provides a unified XML framework that enables multi-device and multi-user Web browsing.  WebSplitter splits a requested Web page and delivers the appropriate partial view of each page to each user, or more accurately to each user's set of devices.  Multiple users can participate in the same browsing session, as in traditional conferencing groupware.  Depending on the access privileges of the user to the different components of content on each page, WebSplitter generates a personalized partial view.  WebSplitter further splits the partial view among the devices available to each user,  e.g. laptop, wireless PDA, projection display, stereo speakers, orchestrating a  composite presentation across the devices.  A wireless PDA can browse while remotely controlling the multimedia capabilities of nearby devices.  The architecture consists of an XML metadata policy file defining access privileges to XML tags on a Web page, a middleware proxy that splits XML Web content to create partial views, and a client-side component, e.g. applet, enabling user login and reception of pushed browsing data.  Service discovery finds and registers proxies, browsing sessions, and device capabilities.  We demonstrate the feasibility of splitting the different tags in an XML Web page to different end users browsers, and of pushing updates from the browsing session to heterogeneous devices, including a laptop and a PDA.},

As a result, users are often not motivated to abandon their favorite single-user applications for groupware features that are less frequently used. A well-accepted approach, collaboration transparency, is able to convert off-the-shelf single-user applications into groupware without modifying the source code. However, existing systems have been largely striving to develop generic application-sharing mechanisms and undesirably force users to share the same application in cooperative work. In this paper we analyze this problem and present a novel approach (called intelligent collaboration transparency) to addressing this problem. Our approach allows for heterogeneous application sharing by considering the particular semantics of the applications and the collaboration task in question.},

	abstract = {Notification is an essential feature in collaborative systems, which determines a system's capability and flexibility in supporting different kinds of collaborative work. In the past years, various notification strategies have been designed for different systems. However, the design of notification components has been ad hoc, and the techniques used for supporting notification have been application-dependent. In this paper, we contribute a flexible notification framework that can be used to describe and compare a range of notification strategies used in existing collaborative systems, and to guide the design of notification components for new collaborative systems. The framework has been applied to the design of a notification component for a group editor, which uses a single notification mechanism to support various notification policies for meeting both real-time and non-real-time collaboration needs. In addition, a new operational transformation control algorithm has been devised in combination with the notification component, which is significantly simpler and more efficient than existing algorithms.},

	abstract = {To design computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) systems that effectively support remote collaboration, designers need a better understanding of how people collaborate face-to-face and the mechanisms that they use to coordinate their actions. While research in CSCW has studied how specific social cues might facilitate collaboration in specific tasks, such as the role of gestures in video instruction, less is known about how a range of communicative cues might facilitate activities across many collaborative settings. In this paper, we model the predictive relationships between facial, gestural, and vocal cues and collaborative outcomes in three different tasks, drawing conclusions on how each cue might contribute to these outcomes in a given task and how such relationships generalize across tasks. The resulting models provide a quantitative understanding of the relative importance of each type of social cue in predicting collaborative outcomes, as well as a more thorough understanding of how the role of each social cue changes across tasks. Additionally, our results provide confirmation and illumination of prior findings in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication research.},

Effectively, the toolkit enables its users to build collaborative applications that utilize digital displays as well as the space between them to interact with information. Our approach also facilitates the management of virtual objects and overcomes gesture restrictions of HoloLens.

	abstract = {In any collaborative system, there are both symmetries and asymmetries present in the design of the technology and in the ways that technology is appropriated. Yet media space research tends to focus more on supporting and fostering the symmetries than the asymmetries. Throughout more than 20 years of media space research, the pursuit of increased symmetry, whether achieved through technical or social means, has been a recurrent theme. The research literature on the use of contemporary awareness systems, in contrast, displays little if any of this emphasis on symmetrical use; indeed, this body of research occasionally highlights the perceived value of asymmetry. In this paper, we unpack the different forms of asymmetry present in both media spaces and contemporary awareness systems. We argue that just as asymmetry has been demonstrated to have value in contemporary awareness systems, so might asymmetry have value in media spaces and in other CSCW systems, more generally. To illustrate, we present a media space that emphasizes and embodies multiple forms of asymmetry and does so in response to the needs of a particular work context.},

Existing telepointing techniques are, however, restricted to pointing at the foremost object underneath a mouse cursor in relaxed-space but strict-time WYSIWIS environments. In real-time collaborative 3D design systems with animation creation capabilities, multiple 3D objects can be simultaneously visible underneath mouse cursors for users to freely and concurrently work on and point at (unconstrained collaboration), and multiple users can view 3D workspaces and point from different viewing perspectives (relaxed-space WYSIWIS) and animation time frames (relaxed-time WYSIWIS). This paper contributes a novel XPointer technique with the capability of pointing through objects correctly and consistently from different viewing perspectives and time frames, even in the presence of concurrent editing work. This work is the first to identify and address these advanced 3D telepointing needs and capabilities, and to extend the concept of relaxed WYSIWIS to include the time aspect. The XPointer has been implemented in the CoMaya real-time collaborative 3D design system (demonstration video: http://cooffice.ntu.edu.sg/comaya/videoXPointer.php).},

We discuss how the new system simultaneously supported collaboration and generated representations and accounts of porters' work. We compare the particular work arrangement in this study with other studies of porters' work, show the widely different configurations of how IT and work can be organized, and argue for the benefit of making comparative studies within CSCW.

The Chinese, consistent with the cultural value of Guanxi, more closely followed a closure model, whereas Americans favored neither a closure nor a structural holes model. These results provide new insights into how needs for social network information may vary between cultures and how social networking sites might support workers in choosing collaborators from within and across national cultures.},

Using a data set of 37,515 revisions from 16,616 unique editors to 96 Wikipedia articles as a case study, we analyze the prevalence and significance of different sequences of editing patterns. We illustrate the mixed method potential of sequence approaches by interpreting the frequent patterns as general classes of behavioral motifs. We conclude by discussing the methodological opportunities for using sequence analysis for expanding existing approaches to analyzing and theorizing about co-production routines in online knowledge collaboration.},

It is scalable in that it allows a single helper to resolve the difficulties of a large number of people in difficulty.

To better understand their impact on collaborative behaviors, perceptions, and performance, we conducted a two-by-two (technology type: HMD vs. tablet computer; task setting: static vs. dynamic) between-subjects study where participants (n=66) remotely collaborated as ``helper' and ``worker' pairs in the construction of a physical object. Our results showed that, in the dynamic task, HMD use enabled helpers to offer more frequent directing commands and more proactive assistance, resulting in marginally faster task completion. In the static task, while tablet use helped convey subtle visual information, helpers and workers had conflicting perceptions of how the two technologies contributed to their success. Our findings offer strong design and research implications, underlining the importance of a consistent view of the shared workspace and the differential support collaborators with different roles receive from technologies.},

We decompose the function into more primitive commands that are executed autonomously by individual users. These commands require a mechanism to dynamically replicate user-interface and program components on a user's site. We present a logging approach for implementing the mechanism that records input (output) messages sent to one incarnation of a program (user-interface) component, and replays the recorded messages to a different incarnation of the component. Preliminary experiments with an implementation of the mechanism show that response and completion times can improve by dynamically changing the architecture to adapt to changes to the set of users in a collaboration session involving a mix of mobile and stationary devices.},

	abstract = {Based on a naturalistic study of industrial designers engaged in collocated collaborative design work in a technologically unsophisticated environment, we observed a number of interactions that lead to a number of insights, namely, (1) seating and the shape and orientation of the working surface has an effect on line of sight and eye-contact behaviors, (2) being able to reach objects on the working surface effects an individual collaborator's ability to become the focus of attention, (3) in collaborative work, people may work on the same document or divide labors to work on different documents simultaneously, (4) supporting the use of conventional artifacts that users are familiar with is as important as supporting the use of informational devices, (5) large workspaces with different privacy levels support both the needs of sharing information and the needs of keeping information private, (6) changes of document orientation socially represents a corresponding change of control and privacy level. From these insights and from other sources in the literature, we describe and illustrate a number of concepts for integrated technologies and environments that can support collocated collaborative work specifically in the context of design work. These concepts are intended as an exercise in divergent design thinking that owes to carefully constructed insights based on observations.},

Dogs trained in explosive detection work alongside human handlers to form a K9 team, which are an integral part of these searches. Officers in K9 teams have a strong bond and communication with these dogs, but noisy locations, long distances, and crowded spaces present challenges. In addition, other officers assigned as backup often lack the experience to read the cues from the canine, which hinders the speed and effectiveness of the team. Coordinating a search with teams from different municipalities presents challenges due to a lack of standard collaboration tools. Getting the right information as quickly as possible saves lives, whether this information is about the areas that have been searched or the location of an explosive device. We hope that in addition to increasing public safety, our system will make working conditions safer for law enforcement officers and their canines.},

Social interactions is captured using Sociometric badges [17] and are visualized on mobile phones to promote behavioral change. Particularly in distributed collaborations, MM attempts to bridge the gap among the distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level without distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and measure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people. Our system encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve interactions across various group collaboration contexts.},

	abstract = {Professionals and researchers of the Architectural, Engi-neering &amp; Construction (AEC) industry are challenged by the increasing complexity of designing, constructing and op-erating a building. This typically requires close cooperation of actors having different backgrounds and interests. Tra-ditionally, this cooperation happens in an ad-hoc way and information exchange occurs through conventional general-purpose communication channels, such as paper or email. This communication and collaboration process can be inad-equate and inefficient, as it makes room for many different interpretations, mistakes and errors and can eventually lead to schedule and cost alterations. We present Green2.0, a system that tries to leverage advancements in building in-formation modeling to facilitate the collaboration process. The system integrates energy-efficiency simulation tools, and methods for online social network analysis to enable a data-driven approach to building design, construction and operation. By sharing all information online, all project ac-tors can access relevant information when they need so that everyone can work efficient together. The system aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals work together throughout a building's lifecycle.},

Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

	abstract = {Designing new technologies to support synchronous interaction across distance has for many years focused on creating symmetry for participation between geographically distributed actors. Symmetry in synchronous interaction has, to some extent, been achieved technologically (while multiple social, historical, political, and hierarchical concerns continue to exist) and proven empirically in the increased use of remote-work technologies that were used during the pandemic. However, synchronous interaction in hybrid work is achieved differently, since the asymmetry produced by some participants being collocated while others geographically distributed introduces increased complexities for such interactions. Focusing on this challenge, we ask: To what extent can symmetry in cooperative work engagements be achieved in hybrid work contexts? We explore this question by interrogating multiple different empirical examples of synchronous hybrid interaction collected across different organizations, activities, and events. We found that the effort required to accomplish hybrid work includes additional articulation work necessary for bounding multiple intertwined artefacts across sites, devices, and applications. Further, the multiple artefacts setup across sites, combined with asymmetric collocation across participants, produce incongruence in technological frames of reference for each participant. All participants in hybrid work have only partial access to the hybrid setup, and no single person has access to the complete setup. The incongruence in technological frames produces insurmountable gaps in collaboration, causing all hybrid work situations to be characterized fundamentally by asymmetric relationships. We argue that symmetry in hybrid synchronous interaction is impossible to attain in attempts to solve this problem through design. Instead, we propose that designers of cooperative technologies for hybrid work shift towards developing artefact-ecologies supporting hybrid work, focusing on asymmetry as a necessary feature. Fundamentally, the design strategy should explore novel ways of taking advantage of the multiple different artefact-ecologies which serve as the foundation for the hybrid collaboration. Instead of striving for symmetry, we propose to feature asymmetric conditions in future technology designs for hybrid interaction.},

	abstract = {People use personal data assistants in the field to collect data and to communicate with others both in the field and office. The individual in the office invariably has a laptop or a high-end personal workstation and thus, significantly more computing power, more screen real estate, and higher volume input devices, such as a mouse and keyboard. These differences give the high-end user the ability to represent and manipulate collaborative tasks more effectively. It is therefore useful to know what impact these differences have on work performance and work communications. Four different platform combinations involving a PC and a PDA were used to examine the effect of communicating via heterogeneous computer platforms. The PC platform used a mouse, a keyboard, and a 3-dimensional screen display. The PDA platform used a stylus, soft buttons, and a 2-dimensional screen display. A variation of the Tetris wall-building game called Slow Tetris was used as the subjects' collaborative task. A second factor in the experiment was role asymmetry. One subject was arbitrarily put in charge of the task solution in all of the combinations. An analysis of the solution times found that subjects with mixed platforms worked slower than their homogeneous counterparts, that is, a person in charge with a PC worked faster if his partner had a PC. An in-depth analysis of the communication patterns found significant differences in the exchanges between heterogeneous and homogenous combinations. The PC-to-PDA combination (with the person on the PC in charge of the solution) took significantly more time than the PC-to-PC combination. This extra time appears to come from the disadvantage of having a partner on the PDA who is unable to help in solving the problems. The PDA-to-PC combination took approximately the same amount of time as the PDA-to-PDA combination despite having one team member with a better representation. This member was, unfortunately, not in charge of the solution. The PDA-to-PC heterogeneous combination exhibited more direction giving, less one-sided collaboration, and more takeover attempts than any of the other combinations. Overall, roles were maintained in the partnerships except for the person with the PDA directing the person with the PC.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been an introduction of sophisticated new video conferencing technologies (e.g., HP Halo, Cisco Telepresence) that have led to enhancements in the collaborative user experience over traditional video conferencing technologies. Traditional video conferencing set-ups often distort the shared spatial properties of action and communication due to screen and camera orientation disparities and other asymmetries. These distortions affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize action and communication. By contrast, new systems, such as Halo, are physically configured to reduce these asymmetries and orientation disparities, thereby minimizing these spatial distortions. By creating appropriate shared spatial geometries, the distributed spaces become “blended” where the spatial geometries of the local space continue coherently across the distributed boundary into the remote site, providing the illusion of a single unified space. Drawing on theories of embodied action and workplace design we discuss the importance of this geometric “blending” of space for distributed collaboration and how this is achieved in systems such as Halo. We then extend these arguments to explore the concept of Blended Interaction Spaces: blended spaces in which interactive groupware is incorporated in ways spatially consistent with the physical geometries of the video-mediated set-up. We illustrate this discussion through a system called BISi that introduces interactive horizontal and vertical multipoint surfaces into a blended video-mediated collaboration space. In presenting this system, we highlight some of the particular challenges of creating these systems arising from the spatial consequences of different interaction mechanisms (e.g., direct touch or remote control) and how they affect movement and spatial configuration of people in these spaces.},

	abstract = {We describe a prototype virtual reality teleconferencing system called MASSIVE which has been developed as part of our on-going research into collaborative virtual environments. This system allows multiple users to communicate using arbitrary combinations of audio, graphics, and text media over local and wide area networks. Communication is controlled by a so-called spatial model of interaction so that one user's perception of another user is sensitive to their relative positions and orientations. The key concept in this spatial model is the (quantitative) awareness which one object has of another. This is controlled by the observing object's focus and the observed object's nimbus, which describe regions of interest and projection, respectively. Each object's aura defines the total region within which it interacts. This is applied independently in each medium. The system (and the spatial model which it implements) is intended to provide a flexible and natural environment for the spatial mediation of conversation. The model also provides a basis for scaling to relatively large numbers of users. Our design goals include supporting heterogeneity, scalability, spatial mediation, balance of power, and multiple concurrent meetings; MASSIVE meets all of these goals. Our initial experiences show the importance of audio in collaborative VR, and they raise issues about field of view for graphical users, speed of navigation, quality of embodiment, varying perceptions of space, and scalability.},
