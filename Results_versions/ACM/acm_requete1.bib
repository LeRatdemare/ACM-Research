abstract = {BirdQuestVR is a cross-platform asymmetric communication game between one player in Virtual Reality and another on a mobile device. The game explores asymmetric co-operative gaming in a shared physical space, taking the physical surroundings of the VR user into account in its design. Asymmetric games feature different rules, abilities, or objectives for different players, generating unique and nuanced game experiences. Multiplayer asymmetric games in particular have been shown to increase teamwork and a collaborative mindset even after a play session has ended. Asymmetric design is commonplace in both digital and analog games but has yet to see widespread adoption in the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) gaming space. BirdQuestVR seeks to leverage the affordances of current consumer-grade VR headsets to build asymmetric gameplay around communication, embodied performance, and physical humour.},

abstract = {Mixed-perspective, combining egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) viewpoints, have been shown to improve the collaborative experience in remote settings. Such experiences allow remote users to switch between different viewpoints to gain alternative perspectives of the remote space. However, existing systems lack seamless selection and transition between multiple perspectives that better fit the task at hand. To address this, we present a new approach called Vicarious, which simplifies and automates the selection between egocentric and exocentric viewpoints. Vicarious employs a context-aware method for dynamically switching or highlighting the optimal viewpoint based on user actions and the current context. To evaluate the effectiveness of the viewpoint selection method, we conducted a user study (n = 27) using an asymmetric AR-VR setup where users performed remote collaboration tasks under four distinct conditions: No-view, Manual, Guided, and Automatic selection. The results showed that Guided and Automatic viewpoint selection improved users’ understanding of the task space and task performance, and reduced cognitive load compared to Manual or No-view selection. The results also suggest that the asymmetric setup had minimal impact on spatial and social presence, except for differences in task load and preference. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for future research in mixed reality collaboration.},

With the freedom and flexibility to choose the most suitable device, we allow for inclusive environments where even spectators can be involved. However, existing research has mostly been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, which limits the applicability of the findings to naturalistic scenarios. We conducted a mixed methods study with social XR experts to explore situated and asymmetrical modalities in the context of XR gaming for enabling social interactions in naturalistic social settings, focusing on two games. We considered variations in available devices, spatial constraints, and users’ motivations and expertise. Our research suggests that asymmetrical interfaces may reduce barriers to entry for XR, support social connection, and promote cross-platform communication and collaboration. Together, our findings provoke critical discussions for future work on the effective deployment of asymmetrical interfaces in naturalistic scenarios and address potential technical, spatial, and social challenges.},

abstract = {Mutual awareness of visual attention is essential for collaborative work. In the field of collaborative virtual environments (CVE), it has been proposed to use Field-of-View (FoV) frustum visualisations as a cue to support mutual awareness during collaboration. Recent studies on FoV frustum visualisations focus on asymmetric collaboration with AR/VR hardware setups and 3D reconstructed environments. In contrast, we focus on the general-purpose CVEs (i.e., VR shared offices), whose popularity is increasing due to the availability of low-cost headsets, and the restrictions imposed by the pandemic. In these CVEs collaboration roles are symmetrical, and the same 2D content available on desktop computers is displayed on 2D surfaces in a 3D space (VR screens). We prototyped one such CVE to evaluate FoV frustrum visualisation within this collaboration scenario. We also implement a FoV visualisation generated from an average fixation map (AFM), therefore directly generated by users' gaze behaviour which we call Cone of Vision (CoV). Our approach to displaying the frustum visualisations is tailored for 2D surfaces in 3D space and allows for self-awareness of this visual cue. We evaluate CoV in the context of a general exploratory data analysis (EDA) with 10 pairs of participants. Our findings indicate that CoV is beneficial during shifts between independent and collaborative work and supports collaborative progression across the visualisation. Self-perception of the CoV improves visual attention coupling, reduces the number of times users watch the collaborator's avatars and offers a consistent representation of the shared reality.},

isbn = {9781479910212},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Heterogeneous computing on CPUs and GPUs has traditionally used fixed roles for each device: the GPU handles data parallel work by taking advantage of its massive number of cores while the CPU handles non data-parallel work, such as the sequential code or data transfer management. Unfortunately, this work distribution can be a poor solution as it under utilizes the CPU, has difficulty generalizing beyond the single CPU-GPU combination, and may waste a large fraction of time transferring data. Further, CPUs are performance competitive with GPUs on many workloads, thus simply partitioning work based on the fixed roles may be a poor choice. In this paper, we present the single kernel multiple devices (SKMD) system, a framework that transparently orchestrates collaborative execution of a single data-parallel kernel across multiple asymmetric CPUs and GPUs. The programmer is responsible for developing a single data-parallel kernel in OpenCL, while the system automatically partitions the workload across an arbitray set of devices, generates kernels to execute the partial workloads, and efficiently merges the partial outputs together. The goal is performance improvement by maximally utilizing all available resources to execute the kernel. SKMD handles the difficult challenges of exposed data transfer costs and the performance variations GPUs have with respect to input size. On real hardware, SKMD achieves an average speedup of 29% on a system with one multicore CPU and two asymmetric GPUs compared to a fastest device execution strategy for a set of popular OpenCL kernels.},

abstract = {Real-time collaboration between multiple simultaneous contributors to a shared document is full of both opportunities and pitfalls, as evidenced by decades of research and industry work in computer-supported cooperative work. In the domain of software engineering, collaboration is still generally achieved either via shared use of a single computer (e.g. pair programming) or with version control (and manual pushing and pulling of changes). By examining and designing for the different roles collaborating programmers play when working synchronously together, we can build real-time collaborative programming systems that make their collaboration more effective. And beyond simple shared editing, we can provide asymmetric, role-specific interfaces on their shared task. Collabode is a web-based IDE for collaborative programming with simultaneous editors that, along with several novel models for closely-collaborative software development, explores the potential of real-time cooperative programming.},

abstract = {Designing new technologies to support synchronous interaction across distance has for many years focused on creating symmetry for participation between geographically distributed actors. Symmetry in synchronous interaction has, to some extent, been achieved technologically (while multiple social, historical, political, and hierarchical concerns continue to exist) and proven empirically in the increased use of remote-work technologies that were used during the pandemic. However, synchronous interaction in hybrid work is achieved differently, since the asymmetry produced by some participants being collocated while others geographically distributed introduces increased complexities for such interactions. Focusing on this challenge, we ask: To what extent can symmetry in cooperative work engagements be achieved in hybrid work contexts? We explore this question by interrogating multiple different empirical examples of synchronous hybrid interaction collected across different organizations, activities, and events. We found that the effort required to accomplish hybrid work includes additional articulation work necessary for bounding multiple intertwined artefacts across sites, devices, and applications. Further, the multiple artefacts setup across sites, combined with asymmetric collocation across participants, produce incongruence in technological frames of reference for each participant. All participants in hybrid work have only partial access to the hybrid setup, and no single person has access to the complete setup. The incongruence in technological frames produces insurmountable gaps in collaboration, causing all hybrid work situations to be characterized fundamentally by asymmetric relationships. We argue that symmetry in hybrid synchronous interaction is impossible to attain in attempts to solve this problem through design. Instead, we propose that designers of cooperative technologies for hybrid work shift towards developing artefact-ecologies supporting hybrid work, focusing on asymmetry as a necessary feature. Fundamentally, the design strategy should explore novel ways of taking advantage of the multiple different artefact-ecologies which serve as the foundation for the hybrid collaboration. Instead of striving for symmetry, we propose to feature asymmetric conditions in future technology designs for hybrid interaction.},

abstract = {In collaborative settings, information management becomes even more challenging. In addition to the classic challenge of information management (i.e. information overload), collaboration also introduces social barriers between group members; this entails asymmetric roles, where different stakeholders have different levels of motivation, knowledge, social capital, authority, or time. To successfully manage their information, groups of people need to coordinate their needs and resources. In my thesis, I focus on building interfaces for lowering social burdens to negotiate and communicate the distribution of resources. I develop coordination systems that guide interaction for collaborative information-management tasks. I first introduce a system called Ziva, which supports interdisciplinary teams by coordinating information exchange. Then, I describe TaskLight, which aims to support information management during the help-seeking process. Lastly, I present challenges of coordinating tool preferences and a resulting system called CollaboRanger.},

abstract = {In the emerging crowd sourced live cast services, numerous amateur broadcasters live stream their video contents to worldwide viewers and constantly interact with them through chat messages. Live video contents are transcoded into multiple quality versions to better service viewers with different network and device configurations. Cloud computing becomes a natural choice to handle these computational intensive tasks due to its elasticity and the "pay-as-you-go" billing model. However, given the significantly large number of concurrent channel numbers and the diverse viewer geo-distributions in this new crowd sourced live cast service, even the cloud becomes significantly expensive to cover the whole community and inadequate in fulfilling the latency requirement. In this paper, after observing the abundant computational resources residing in end viewers, we propose a Cloud-Crowd collaborative system, C2, which combines end viewers with cloud to perform video transcoding in a cost-efficient way. To quantify the heterogeneity and uncertainty of viewers and pass the asymmetric information barrier, we incorporate statistical descriptions into our bidding language and design truthful auctions to recruit stable viewers with appropriate incentives. We further tailor redundancy strategies for workloads with different Quality of Service requirements to improve the stability of our system. Desirable economic properties, like social efficiency, ex-post incentive compatibility, individual rationality, are proved to be guaranteed in our studied scenarios. Using traces captured from the popular Twitch platform, we show that C2 achieves up to 93% more cost saving than a pure cloud-based solution, and significantly outperforms other baseline approaches in both social welfare and system stability.},

On the other hand, when the design process is complex and involves multiple stakeholders, decisions are taken in meetings hosted in the physical world. In the case of aerospace industrial designs, the process is accelerated by having asymmetric collaboration between the two locations: experts discuss the possibilities in a meeting room while a technician immersed in VR tests the selected alternatives. According to experts, the current approach is not without limitations, and in this work, we present prototypes designed to tackle them. The described artefacts were created to address the main issues: awareness of the remote location, remote interaction and manipulation, and navigation between locations. First feedback from experts regarding the prototypes is also presented. The resulting design considerations can be used in other asymmetric collaborative scenarios.},

abstract = {People use personal data assistants in the field to collect data and to communicate with others both in the field and office. The individual in the office invariably has a laptop or a high-end personal workstation and thus, significantly more computing power, more screen real estate, and higher volume input devices, such as a mouse and keyboard. These differences give the high-end user the ability to represent and manipulate collaborative tasks more effectively. It is therefore useful to know what impact these differences have on work performance and work communications. Four different platform combinations involving a PC and a PDA were used to examine the effect of communicating via heterogeneous computer platforms. The PC platform used a mouse, a keyboard, and a 3-dimensional screen display. The PDA platform used a stylus, soft buttons, and a 2-dimensional screen display. A variation of the Tetris wall-building game called Slow Tetris was used as the subjects' collaborative task. A second factor in the experiment was role asymmetry. One subject was arbitrarily put in charge of the task solution in all of the combinations. An analysis of the solution times found that subjects with mixed platforms worked slower than their homogeneous counterparts, that is, a person in charge with a PC worked faster if his partner had a PC. An in-depth analysis of the communication patterns found significant differences in the exchanges between heterogeneous and homogenous combinations. The PC-to-PDA combination (with the person on the PC in charge of the solution) took significantly more time than the PC-to-PC combination. This extra time appears to come from the disadvantage of having a partner on the PDA who is unable to help in solving the problems. The PDA-to-PC combination took approximately the same amount of time as the PDA-to-PDA combination despite having one team member with a better representation. This member was, unfortunately, not in charge of the solution. The PDA-to-PC heterogeneous combination exhibited more direction giving, less one-sided collaboration, and more takeover attempts than any of the other combinations. Overall, roles were maintained in the partnerships except for the person with the PDA directing the person with the PC.},

In our research, a pair of participants played a game in real-time, using either the VR setup or the desktop setup. In Competition mode, the two participants were asked to defeat each other. In Collaboration mode, the pair of participants played as a team and were asked to defeat a pair of AI enemies. Our results show the VR group reported a better gaming experience and perceptual responses compared to the desktop group regardless of game mode, but that the desktop group showed superior gaming performance compared to the VR group in Competition mode.},

TeleSight provides two interaction layers for designing asymmetric interaction, a physical layer for direct tangible interaction with players in VR space and visual layer that visually expresses VR space. Each layer is constructed by an avatar robot that imitates the motion of the HMD user, and a projection system. Non-HMD users can understand what happens in the virtual world by each interaction layers. Also, Non-HMD users can interact tangibly with the players in VR space throughout avatar robot. TeleSight provides that cooperative co-located gameplay between HMD user and Non-HMD users through experience scenarios using two layers.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) users often need to work with other users, who observe them outside of VR using an external display. Communication between them is difficult; the VR user cannot see the external user's gestures, and the external user cannot see VR scene elements outside of the VR user's view. We carried out formative interviews with experts to understand these asymmetrical interactions and identify their goals and challenges. From this, we identify high-level system design goals to facilitate asymmetrical interactions and a corresponding space of implementation approaches based on the level of programmatic access to a VR application. We present TransceiVR, a system that utilizes VR platform APIs to enable asymmetric communication interfaces for third-party applications without requiring source code access. TransceiVR allows external users to explore the VR scene spatially or temporally, to annotate elements in the VR scene at correct depths, and to discuss via a shared static virtual display. An initial co-located user evaluation with 10 pairs shows that our system makes asymmetric collaborations in VR more effective and successful in terms of task time, error rate, and task load index. An informal evaluation with a remote expert gives additional insight on utility of features for real world tasks.},

abstract = {As the variety of possible interactions with virtual reality (VR) continues to expand, researchers need a way to relate these interactions to users' needs and goals in ways that advance understanding. Existing efforts have focused mainly on the symmetric use of technology, which excludes a rising form of interaction known as asymmetric VR, in which co-located participants use different interfaces to interact with a shared environment. There must be a clear path to creating asymmetric VR systems that are rooted in previous work from several fields, as these systems have use cases in education, hybrid reality teams (using VR and other technologies to interact online and face to face), accessibility, as well as entertainment. Currently, there is no systematic way to characterize 1) how a system may be asymmetric, 2) how the different mediation technology and affordances within asymmetric VR support (or do not support) users' goals, and 3) the relationships and collaborative capabilities between users of these different technologies. In this paper, the authors use a scoping review to explore relevant conceptual frameworks for asymmetric interaction, mediation technology, and computer supported cooperative work to clarify the dimensions of asymmetry and synthesize the literature into a Composite framework for Asymmetric VR (CAVR). The paper concludes with suggestions of ways to test and expand the framework in order to guide future research as it identifies the most-beneficial interaction paradigms for co-located asymmetric VR.},

Today, asymmetric communication between a VR user and other non-VR users remains a challenge. The VR user cannot see the external non-VR users, and the non-VR users are restricted to the VR user’s first-person view. To address this, we propose WebTransceiVR, an asymmetric collaboration toolkit which when integrated into a VR application, allows multiple non-VR users to share the virtual space of the VR user. It allows external users to enter and be part of the VR application’s space through standard web browsers on mobile and computers. These external users can explore and interact with the other users, the VR scene as well as the VR user. WebTransceiVR also includes a cloud-based streaming solution that enables many passive spectators to view the scene through any of the active cameras. We conduct informal user testing to gain additional insights for future work.},

We conducted a first study to investigate trade-offs of three remote representations of an AR workspace: a fully virtual representation, a first-person view, and an external view. Building on our findings, we designed ARgus, a multi-view video-mediated communication system that combines these representations through interactive tools for navigation, previewing, pointing, and annotation. We report on a second user study that observed how 12 participants used ARgus to provide remote instructions for an AR furniture arrangement task. Participants extensively used its view transition tools, while the system reduced their reliance on verbal instructions.},

abstract = {Computing systems today typically employ, in addition to powerful CPUs, various types of specialized devices such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Such heterogeneous systems are evolving towards tighter integration of devices for improved performance and reduced energy consumption. Compared to traditional use of GPUs and FPGAs as offload accelerators, this tight integration enables close collaboration between processors which is important for better utilization of system resources and higher performance. Programming interfaces are also adapting rapidly to tightly integrated heterogeneous platforms by introducing features such as shared virtual memory, memory coherence, and system-wide atomics, making collaborative computing among different devices even more practical.In this paper, we survey current integrated heterogeneous systems and corresponding collaboration techniques. We evaluate the impact of collaborative computing on two heterogeneous integrated systems, CPU-GPU and CPU-FPGA, using OpenCL. Finally, we discuss the limitation of OpenCL and envision what suitable programming languages for collaborative computing will look like.},

Also, programming environments in general are usually designed to promote individual experiences, wasting the potential benefits of group collaborative activities. We propose the design of a programming environment that leverages asymmetric roles to foster collaborative computational thinking activities for children with visual impairments, in particular mixed-visual-ability classes. The multimodal system comprises the use of tangible blocks and auditory feedback, while children have to collaborate to program a robot.

We explored these in the design and development of a collaborative VR system that allows interaction through a mobile touchscreen device (Handheld User) and a head-mounted display (HMD User). In a qualitative evaluation, we further analyzed how these interfaces affect social roles and user interactions during collaboration. Our observations reveal that Handheld Users achieved presence in the virtual environment, despite the non-immersive interface, and assumed similar spatial positions in a conversational scenario as they would in the real world. In a collaborative building task, we found leadership roles not tied to immersion, but potentially influenced by users’ eye-level. Further, Handheld Users exhibited stronger movement patterns than HMD Users. Based on such behavioral patterns, we contribute a classification framework for Handheld Users that facilitates future analysis of interactions in shared virtual environments through handheld devices. Finally, we offer several design considerations for collaborative cross-device VR, which are based on our observations and exemplified in our presented system.},

However, spatial awareness of each other's activities is limited as physical spaces, including the position of physical devices, are often incongruent. Therefore, alignment methods are needed to support activities on physical devices. In this paper, we present the concept of Re-locations, a method for enabling remote collaboration with augmented reality in incongruent spaces. The idea of the concept is to enrich remote collaboration activities on multiple physical devices with attributes of co-located collaboration such as spatial awareness and spatial referencing by locally relocating remote user representations to user-defined workspaces. We evaluated the Re-locations concept in an explorative user study with dyads using an authentic, collaborative task. Our findings indicate that Re-locations introduce attributes of co-located collaboration like spatial awareness and social presence. Based on our findings, we provide implications for future research and design of remote collaboration systems using AR.},

abstract = {Vision is essential to address maritime activities, and there is a lot of information to handle collectively. Augmented Reality (AR) is well suited to answer these challenges, but operational needs introduce specificities that distinguish AR solutions from those of other domains: multiple long range panoramic or pointed sensors, various data and video fusion sources, native video quality with low latency, crew shared situation...This paper describes the operational needs related to a system named VISIPROT® (VISual Information system for PROTection) dedicated to asymmetric warfare, which means ship protection against terrorist attack, and navigation. It relates the maturation of a first real-time at-shore demonstrator (early prototype without full capabilities) that allowed three French navy mariners to operate it in defense scenarios against a speed boat during an experiment.VISIPROT aims to be on board in 2016 and introduces a dedicated AR collaboration concept based on a shared "visual situation". This visual situation corresponds to tactical and nautical situation displayed on the video provided by the 360° on board surveillance sensor. It allows users to coordinate easily with others local, remote or distant users. It allows sharing situational awareness, complying with engagement rules, and following decisions.},

abstract = {Physical face-to-face collaboration with someone gives a higher-quality experience compared to mediated communication options, such as a phone- or video-based chat. Participants can share rich sensory cues to multiple human senses in a physical space. Also, the perceptual sensing of the surrounding environment including other peoples' reactions can influence human communication and emotion, and thus collaborative performance. Shared spaces in virtual environments provide degraded sensory experiences because most commercial virtual reality systems typically provide only visual and audio feedback. The impact of richer, multi-sensory feedback on joint decision-making tasks in VR is still an open area of research. Two independent studies exploring this topic are presented in this paper. We implemented a multi-sensory system that delivers vision, audio, tactile, and smell feedback, and we compared the system to a typical VR system. The scenario placed two users in a virtual theme-park safari ride with a number of non-player character (NPC) passengers to simulate realistic scenarios compared to the real-world and we varied the type and complexity of NPCs reactions to participants.In Experiment 1, we provided both users with either multi-sensory or typical sensory feedback symmetrically as a between-subjects factor, and used NPC reaction type as a within-subjects factor. In Experiment 2, we provided sensory feedback asymmetrically to each user (i.e., one had multi-sensory cues and the other had typical sensory cues) as a between-subjects factor, and used NPC reaction type as a within-subjects factor. We found that the number of sensory channels and NPC reactions did not influence user perception significantly under either symmetric or asymmetric sensory feedback conditions. However, after accounting for individual personality traits (e.g., assertive, passive), as well as any existing relationship between the pairs, we found that increasing the number of sensory channels can significantly improve subjective responses.},

abstract = {Collaborating across dissimilar, distributed spaces presents numerous challenges for computer-aided spatial communication. Mixed reality (MR) can blend selected surfaces, allowing collaborators to work in blended f-formations (facing formations), even when their workstations are physically misaligned. Since collaboration often involves more than just participant pairs, this research examines how we might scale MR experiences for large-group collaboration. To do so, this study recruited collaboration designers (CDs) to evaluate and reimagine MR for large-scale collaboration. These CDs were engaged in a four-part user study that involved a technology probe, a semi-structured interview, a speculative low-fidelity prototyping activity and a validation session. The outcomes of this paper contribute (1) a set of collaboration design principles to inspire future computer-supported collaborative work, (2) eight collaboration patterns for blended f-formations and collaboration at scale and (3) theoretical implications for f-formations and space-place relationships. As a result, this work creates a blueprint for scaling collaboration across distributed spaces.},

One viewpoint is that of the space designers, who observe and alter the space from a top-down view using a large table-top interface. The other viewpoint is that of a space occupant, who observes the space through internal views using a head-mounted display. We conducted two studies to understand how our system support users in architectural-scale space design. One is about preliminary user study to observe general behavior to Dollhouse VR system, and the other one is a case study that users are actual employees of restaurant and discuss rearrangement of floor by moving tables and chairs in virtual environment. Results showed that the system supports a pair of interaction techniques that could facilitate communication between these two user viewpoints.},

abstract = {This research addresses architecture-scale problem-solving involving the design of living or working spaces, such as architecture and floor plans. Such design systems require two different viewpoints: a small-scale internal view, i.e., a first-person view of the space to see local details as an occupant of the space, and a large-scale external view, i.e., a top-down view of the entire space to make global decisions when designing the space. Architects or designers need to switch between these two viewpoints to make various decisions, but this can be inefficient and time-consuming. We present a system to address the problem, which facilitates asymmetric collaboration between users requiring these different viewpoints. One group of users comprises the designers of the space, who observe and manipulate the space from a top-down view using a large tabletop interface. The other group of users represents occupants of the space, who observe and manipulate the space based on internal views using head-mounted displays (HMDs). The system also supports a set of interaction techniques to facilitate communication between these two user groups. Our system can be used for the design of various spaces, such as offices, restaurants, operating rooms, parks, and kindergartens.},

abstract = {Patient safety errors account for over 400,000 preventable deaths annually in US in hospitals alone, 70% of which are caused by team communication breakdowns, stemming from hierarchical structures and asymmetrical power dynamics between physicians, nurses, patients, and others. Nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and prevent these errors, but they are often penalized for speaking up, particularly when physicians are responsible. Nevertheless, empowering nurses and building strong interdisciplinary teams can lead to improved patient safety and outcomes. Thus, our group has been developing a series of intelligent systems that support teaming in safety critical settings, Robot-Centric Team Support System (RoboTSS), and recently developed a group detection and tracking system for collaborative robots. In this paper, we explore how RoboTSS can be used to empower nurses in interprofessional team settings, through a three month long, collaborative design process with nurses across five US-based hospitals. The main findings and contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we found that participants envisioned using a robotic crash cart to guide resuscitation procedures to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Second, nurses discussed how RoboTSS can generate choreography for efficient spatial reconfigurations in co-located clinical teams, which is particularly important in time-sensitive situations such as resuscitation. Third, we found that nurses want to use RoboTSS to "stop the line," and disrupt power dynamics by policing unsafe physician behavior, such as avoiding safety protocols using a robotic crash cart. Fourth, nurses envisioned using our system to support real-time error identification, such as breaking the sterile field, and then communicating those errors to physicians, to relieve them of responsibility. Finally, based on our findings, we propose robot design implications that capture how nurses envision utilizing RoboTSS. We hope this work promotes further exploration in how to design technology to challenge authority in asymmetrical power relationships, particularly in healthcare, as strong teams save lives.},

OmniGlobeVR allows designer(s) to explore the VR space from any point of view using two view modes: a 360° first-person mode and a third-person mode. In addition, a shared gaze awareness cue is provided to further enhance communication between the occupant and the designer(s). Finally, the system has a face window feature that allows designer(s) to share their facial expressions and upper body view with the occupant for exchanging and expressing information using nonverbal cues. We conducted a user study to evaluate the OmniGlobeVR, comparing three conditions: (1) first-person mode with the face window, (2) first-person mode with a solid window, and (3) third-person mode with the face window. We found that the first-person mode with the face window required significantly less mental effort, and provided better spatial presence, usability, and understanding of the partner's focus. We discuss the design implications of these results and directions for future research.},

This is desired due to the specific characteristics of ML modeling in practice, namely the complexity of ML, the interdisciplinary approach in industry, and the need for ML interpretability. In this work, we introduce an augmented reality-based system for collaborative immersive analytics that is designed to support ML modeling in interdisciplinary teams. We conduct a user study to examine how collaboration unfolds when users with different professional backgrounds and levels of ML knowledge interact in solving different ML tasks. Specifically, we use the pair analytics methodology and performance assessments to assess collaboration and explore their interactions with each other and the system. Based on this, we provide qualitative and quantitative results on both teamwork and taskwork during collaboration. Our results show how our system elicits sustained collaboration as measured along six distinct dimensions. We finally make recommendations how immersive systems should be designed to elicit sustained collaboration in ML modeling.},

abstract = {People are increasingly using more and more social softwares, generating flooding communications. User analytics may be performed to mine a person's activities on different social systems and extract patterns, be it interest patterns, social patterns, or work patterns. Such patterns may benefit both the individuals and the organizations the users associated with, as the information is valuable in numerous tasks, including recommendation, evaluation, management, and so on. In this article, we present an actionable solution of user analytics, namely collaboration analytics, by focusing on mining a person's work patterns from her collaboration activities. Our solution effectively makes use of a user's heterogeneous data collected from various collaboration tools to derive an integrated description of the user's collaborative work. A number of ``work areas'', each of which contains its work topics and people involved, are generated for every user. The challenges we face include the clustering of items with short texts and prioritizing/weighting data items based on importance/relevance. Our solutions to those issues will be described in this article. In particular, we mine users' background information from various types of data and use such information to enrich the semantics of the short texts contained in the activity instances on collaboration tools before clustering those instances into work areas. Finally, we have developed a prototype of our collaboration analytics solution and evaluated it with real-world data and people.},

abstract = {Mobile teamwork has become an emerging requirement in the daily business of large enterprises. Employees collaborate across locations and need support while they are on the move. Business documents (artifacts) and expertise need to be shared independent of the actual location or connectivity (e.g., access through a mobile phone, laptop, Personal Digital Assistant, etc.) of employees. Although many collaboration tools and systems exist, most do not deal with new requirements such as locating artifacts and experts through distributed searches, advanced information subscription and notification, and mobile information sharing and access. The MOTION service architecture that we have developed supports mobile teamwork by taking into account the different connectivity modes of users, provides access support for various devices such as laptop computers and mobile phones, and uses XML meta-data and the XML Query Language (XQL) for distributed searches and subscriptions. In this paper, we describe the architecture and the components of our generic MOTION service platform for building collaborative applications. The MOTION Teamwork Services Components are currently being evaluated in two industry case-studies.},

abstract = {Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration provides an enhanced immersive experience where a remote user can provide verbal and nonverbal assistance to a local user to increase the efficiency and performance of the collaboration. This is usually achieved by sharing the local user's environment through live 360 video or a 3D scene, and using visual cues to gesture or point at real objects allowing for better understanding and collaborative task performance. While most of prior work used one of the methods to capture the surrounding environment, there may be situations where users have to choose between using 360 panoramas or 3D scene reconstruction to collaborate, as each have unique benefits and limitations. In this paper we designed a prototype system that combines 360 panoramas into a 3D scene to introduce a novel way for users to interact and collaborate with each other. We evaluated the prototype through a user study which compared the usability and performance of our proposed approach to live 360 video collaborative system, and we found that participants enjoyed using different ways to access the local user's environment although it took them longer time to learn to use our system. We also collected subjective feedback for future improvements and provide directions for future research.},

abstract = {Why develop educational practices involving computing for the social good? Does the field of ethics provide a viable framework for assessing an evaluating such practices? And are projects that involve students in computing for the social good efficacious in the formation of ethical computing professionals? At Carnegie Mellon, we have developed practices to involve a significant number of students in software development projects and consulting engagements for the social good. A consulting course has had over 500 community service-learning engagements in 18 years, and in a software development capstone course our yearly cohort of 60 students work in small teams to develop software for 15+ social service organizations. Our practices have evolved out of our shared vision of what makes a good computing professional, but we would now like to better define, assess, and communicate what the vision is.The NSF has a program solicitation (15-528) entitled Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM (CCE STEM) that "funds research projects that identify factors that are efficacious in the formation of ethical STEM researchers in all the fields of science and engineering that NSF supports." It asks: "What constitutes ethical STEM research and practice? Which cultural and institutional contexts promote ethical STEM research and practice and why?" Among the factors they mention are "curricula ... that stress social responsibility and humanitarian goals"; i.e. computing for the social good. And "what practices contribute to the establishment and maintenance of ethical cultures and how can these practices be transferred, extended to, and integrated into other research and learning settings?"To provide some context from my experience, there are two prevalent types of computing-for-the-social-good projects:1. System-based: Projects that address a social-good (e.g. disaster management, public accountability, or medical record management) and are generally released to the public as open source projects (e.g. Sahana, Ushahidi, or OpenMRS).2. Client-based: Projects that custom-build a solution for a nonprofit, school, international NGO, or other social-good organization. For example, helping a nonprofit increase fundraising with a website, or a school improve interaction with its students using a course management system. Often, but not always, these solutions use the open source projects in (1), but in all cases the solution involves much more work than fetching the software.Our consulting and capstone project course use the client-based model. When done well, client-based social-good projects have the potential to enrich student learning in ambiguous real world environments. Students report increased confidence, further development of technical skills, a sense of satisfaction and appreciation for the needs of their partner organizations.Delivery of a tangible benefit to partner organizations is also generally an expected outcome. Providing lasting value to community partners should, in practice, be a key objective of any serious client engagement. However too often, the needs, concerns and ultimate outcomes for community partners are often overlooked or forgotten. Solutions that are incomplete, poorly implemented, poorly documented, inappropriate to the problem at hand or simply unsustainable may provide little or no value to community partners. In fact, these solutions may actually be detrimental to partner organizations.There is significant risk, therefore, that benefits to ICT service learning projects are asymmetric; students generally report significant benefits from the experience, but community based partners may, in fact, find the experience expensive, risky, and potentially harmful to their missions, organizations and employees. Many community partners simply do not have the resources to finish incomplete projects, sustain or maintain complex software or systems, or perform needed application or server administration.We use a capacity-building model of working with a community partner. This is not the let-us-buildyou-a-system model, where students develop and drop in (often unsustainable) technology solutions. Rather, it emphasizes working-with, and weaving solutions into the development partner's organization, building their capacity to not only use, but to maintain and evolve their solutions as their needs grow and change.Returning to the bigger question of cultivating a culture of ethical practice, these classes are meant to model an ethic of care in meeting the needs of a nonprofit client whose mission is the social good.They expose students to issues of:- Being truthful in working with the client: not misrepresenting their capabilities nor the robustness of their solution.- Being respectful and not misusing the client's time and other resources.- Not taking advantage of their team mates via slacking and free-loading.- Safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of citizen information in any system they build, and including controls that maintain appropriate privacy and confidentiality.- Not misappropriating software, being aware of licenses, and attributing borrowed work that is otherwise not licensed.- Understanding the role of nonprofit organizations in society. How they are similar and different from for-profit corporations. How they contribute to the social good where markets would not otherwise serve.The NSF solicitation provides an opportunity to support looking at both why we do computing for the social good, and whether these educational practices develop computing professionals who are more aware of the ethical dimensions of their work. The solicitation encourages a comparison across institutions; is SIGCAS a good nexus for building that collaboration?As part of the SIGCAS Symposium, the author shared practices in the consulting and software development capstone courses, and the nascent evaluation ideas they are piloting. A goal is to get others' feedback and explore possibilities for collaboration.},

abstract = {We present a system [1] that allows wireless smartphones to be
used for mathematics communication, that is, for the creation and
exchange of mathematical formulas, diagrams, and text between two
or more participants. The system enables two or more persons with
smartphones or traditional computers to participate in a session.
Each of the participants may convey textual, graphical and
mathematical information to the other participants. Users can draw,
edit, and label geometric shapes, send chat messages, and compose
formulas. A turn taking mechanism moderates the communication. The
system also supports the integration of services that can be used
to provide individual users with additional functionality.
Currently, a LATEX rendering service is available to allow users to
create and share mathematical formulas in typeset quality.Wireless smartphones are becoming the medium of choice for
improvised synchronous collaboration since increasing numbers of
users carry their smartphones at all times. It is true that the
small size of the devices---while necessary for their
ubiquity---limits the complexity of collaborative tasks that can be
carried out effectively. On the other hand, there is a need to
capture inspiration, to access and evaluate information on the go,
and to make decisions on the spot.The domain of mathematics is ideally suited to explore---and
push---the limits of smartphone communication. The challenge of
representing mathematics in typeset form has led to the development
of document preparation systems such as TEX, LATEX, and LYX which
are in widespread use today. Mathematical handwriting recognition
continues to push the limits of general handwriting recognition
[2]. Many of the cognitive challenges that arise in mathematical
collaboration also arise in intellectual teamwork in other
domains.Some of the challenges of developing a system for mobile
mathematics communication are posed by the input and output
limitations of the devices and the enormous heterogeneity of the
available hardware platforms.We use the Treo 600/650 as our hardware platform. Our software
is written in pure Java and can be run on any platform that
supports the Java Virtual Machine. Our software architecture makes
it easy to add new local or remote services to enhance the
communication.The poster presents use-case diagrams, architecture diagrams,
and a series of screenshots that describe the user's interaction
with the system. The poster also shows how we solved the problems
of cross-referencing and turn-taking in mobile collaboration. A
7.5-minute video shows users interacting with the system.},

Previous research in human-computer interaction has supported individuals with chronic conditions or their caregivers, but little has supported both as a unit. We conducted a field study with 12 patient-caregiver dyads, all married and living together, to identify partners' values and how they shape collaborative management of MCC. Partners' coinciding values motivated them to empathize with and support each other in the face of challenges related to health and well-being. When their values were asymmetric, they perceived tensions between individual autonomy and their ability to coordinate with their partner. Systems to support partners in this context could help them overcome asymmetric values, but should balance this with support for individual autonomy.},

abstract = {Real-time collaboration between a requester and crowd workers expands the scope of tasks that crowdsourcing can be used for by letting requesters and crowd workers interactively create various artifacts (e.g., a sketch prototype, writing, or program code). In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups. Finally, we make design recommendations that can inform the design of future real-time collaboration processes in crowdsourcing systems.},

One way to improve teamwork is to provide dynamic feedback generated by automated analyses of behavior, such as language use. Such feedback can lead members to reflect on and subsequently improve their collaborative behavior, but might also distract from the task at hand. We have experimented with GroupMeter - a chat-based system that presents visual feedback on team members' language use. Feedback on proportion of agreement words and overall word count was presented using two different designs. When receiving feedback, teams in our study expressed more agreement in their conversations and reported greater focus on language use as compared to when not receiving feedback. This suggests that automated, real-time linguistic feedback can elicit behavioral changes, offering opportunities for future research.},

Following this idea, we continued by an in-depth analysis of Grid Society environment from systematical aspect and designed a service-based architecture for VAST, a resource integration system. In VAST, Grid and P2P Resource Access Entry assists the Portal to co-schedule resources by providing a set of well-defined service interfaces; DCI, a P2P software system, was also developed to meet the special requirements of Portal; and Portal, coordinator of the whole system, links those two Access Entries and provides a friendly interface to the End Users for controlling and monitoring the submitted jobs. VAST has already been implemented using Java and Web Service technologies, which helps to achieve good portability. Further more, an experiment of parameter sweep application has also been conducted to test the prototype of VAST and through it VAST shows a promising potential for the collaboration of different kinds of resources.},

abstract = {With the increasing number of higher education students using e-learning technology, collaborative learning has been suggested as a solution to the lack of sufficient support to learners in e-learning environments, particularly LMS (Learning Management System). Nevertheless, current collaborative learning puts a heavy emphasis on group discussion, but provides inadequate support for individual learners to promote teamwork during the whole learning process.The aim of this paper is to propose an intelligent LMS able to improve student's collaboration practices in higher education. The system provides teachers information about the levels of collaboration and productivity of each student and group; and as a result, teachers exploit data provided to promote collaborative learning, avoid students' isolation and motivate them to use collaboration tools. The intelligent LMS called "smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS" integrates a Multi-Agents System (MAS) responsible to the tracking of collaboration and productivity levels of each student and group. On the other hand, in order to optimize the large-scale resource management, the proposed smart-Cloud Collaborative LMS is based on a cloud computing architecture.},

abstract = {Edge intelligence has emerged as a promising paradigm to accelerate DNN inference by model partitioning, which is particularly useful for intelligent scenarios that demand high accuracy and low latency. However, the dynamic nature of the edge environment and the diversity of end devices pose a significant challenge for DNN model partitioning strategies. Meanwhile, limited resources of the edge server make it difficult to manage resource allocation efficiently among multiple devices. In addition, most of the existing studies disregard the different service requirements of the DNN inference tasks, such as its high accuracy-sensitive or high latency-sensitive. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Compression Scale DNN Inference Acceleration (MCIA) based on cloud-edge-end collaboration. We model this problem as a mixed-integer multi-dimensional optimization problem, jointly optimizing the DNN model version choice, the partitioning choice, and the allocation of computational and bandwidth resources to maximize the tradeoff between inference accuracy and latency depending on the property of the tasks. Initially, we train multiple versions of DNN inference models with different compression scales in the cloud, and deploy them to end devices and edge server. Next, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed for joint decision making of adaptive collaborative inference and resource allocation based on the current multi-compression scale models and the task property. Experimental results show that MCIA can adapt to heterogeneous devices and dynamic networks, and has superior performance compared with other methods.},

abstract = {The ever increasing deployment of broadband networks and simultaneous proliferation of low cost video capturing and multimedia enabled mobile devices have triggered a wave of novel mobile multimedia applications, resulting in the development of large scale systems for delivery of video streams to heterogeneous resource constrained mobile clients. Invariably, the video streams need to be personalized to provide a resource constrained mobile device with video content that is most relevant to the client's request while simultaneously satisfying the client-side and system-wide resource constraints. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a distributed system, consisting of several geographically distributed video personalization servers and proxy caches, for efficient dissemination of personalized video in a resource constrained mobile environment. With the objective of optimizing cache performance, a novel cache replacement policy and multi-stage client request aggregation strategy, both of which are specifically tailored for personalized video content, are proposed. A novel latency-biased collaborative caching protocol based on counting Bloom filters is designed for further enhancing the scalability and efficiency of disseminating personalized video content. The benefits and costs associated with collaborative caching for disseminating personalized video content to resource constrained and geographically distributed clients are analyzed and experimentally verified. The impact of different levels of collaboration amongst the caches and, the advantages of using multiple video personalization servers with varying degrees of mirrored content on the efficiency of personalized video delivery, are also studied. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed collaborative caching scheme, coupled with the proposed personalization-aware cache replacement and client request aggregation strategies, provides a means for efficient dissemination of personalized video streams in resource constrained environments.},

abstract = {Over the past years, augmented reality (AR) based on mobile phones has gained great attention. When multiple phones are used in AR applications, collaborative simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is considered one of the enabling technologies, i.e., multiple mobile phones complete the localization and mapping through collaboration. However, the state-of-the-art collaborative SLAM systems not only suffer from the delays introduced by a high-complexity graph optimization problem, but also may exhibit varying levels of accuracy across dissimilar environments or different types of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable and robust collaborative SLAM system, point-line-based Collaborative SLAM (ColSLAM). Technically, ColSLAM includes two innovative features that help achieve satisfactory scalability and robustness. First, a mapping cacher (MC) is designed for each agent on the server, which uses global keyframes to detect loop closures, updates the cached local map, and quickly responds to the agent's pose drifts. With MC, each agent's local pose is corrected using global knowledge in real-time. Secondly, to improve the robustness performance, ColSLAM employs point-line-fusion-based Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO), point-line-fusion-based NetVLAD loop detection, and an enhanced geometric verification and relative pose calculation method called PNPL. Empirical evaluations based on the EuRoc dataset and real degenerate environments demonstrate that ColSLAM outperforms the existing collaborative SLAM systems in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.},

abstract = {Knowledge networks and recommender systems are especially important for expert finding within organizations and scientific communities. Useful recommendation of experts, however, is not an easy task for many reasons: It requires reasoning about multiple complex networks from heterogeneous sources (such as collaboration networks of individuals, article citation networks, and concept networks) and depends significantly on the needs of individuals in seeking recommendations.Although over the past decade much effort has gone into developing techniques to increase and evaluate the quality of recommendations, personalizing recommendations according to individuals' motivations has not received much attention. While previous work in the literature has focused primarily on identifying experts, our focus here is on personalizing the selection of an expert through a principled application of social science theories to model the user's motivation. In this paper, we present an expert recommender system capable of applying multiple theoretical mechanisms to the problem of personalized recommendations through profiling users' motivations and their relations. To this end, we use the Multi-Theoretical Multi-Level (MTML) framework which investigates social drivers for network formation in the communities with diverse goals. This framework serves as the theoretical basis for mapping motivations to the appropriate domain data, heuristic, and objective functions for the personalized expert recommendation.As a proof of concept, we developed a prototype recommender grounded in social science theories, and utilizing computational techniques from social network analysis and representational techniques from the semantic web to facilitate combining and operating on data from heterogeneous sources. We evaluated the prototype's ability to predict collaborations for scientific research teams, using a simple off-line methodology. Preliminary results demonstrate encouraging success while offering significant personalization options and providing flexibility in customizing the recommendation heuristic based on users' motivations. In particular, recommendation heuristics based on different motivation profiles result in different recommendations, and taken as a whole better capture the diversity of observed expert collaboration.},

abstract = {Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are the dominant form of enabling Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) for personal use. One of the biggest challenges of HMDs is the exclusion of people in the vicinity, such as friends or family. While recent research on asymmetric interaction for VR HMDs has contributed to solving this problem in the VR domain, AR HMDs come with similar but also different problems, such as conflicting information in visualization through the HMD and projection. In this work, we propose ShARe, a modified AR HMD combined with a projector that can display augmented content onto planar surfaces to include the outside users (non-HMD users). To combat the challenge of conflicting visualization between augmented and projected content, ShARe visually aligns the content presented through the AR HMD with the projected content using an internal calibration procedure and a servo motor. Using marker tracking, non-HMD users are able to interact with the projected content using touch and gestures. To further explore the arising design space, we implemented three types of applications (collaborative game, competitive game, and external visualization). ShARe is a proof-of-concept system that showcases how AR HMDs can facilitate interaction with outside users to combat exclusion and instead foster rich, enjoyable social interactions.},

This trend presents many opportunities for information sharing and collaboration among massively distributed data sources. However, the current mobile environment, which consists of incompatible operating systems, development models, and communication options, has hindered application development and data sharing over ad hoc networks of mobile devices. In this paper, we present a middleware framework, called \"{I}nf\"{\i}n\"{\i}ty, that unifies techniques for local (and remote) device data access, automatic communication channel selection, and application deployment across heterogeneous platforms. \"{I}nf\"{\i}n\"{\i}ty enables information sharing and collaboration among mobile devices in a privacy-preserving manner. We describe the prototype implementation of \"{I}nf\"{\i}n\"{\i}ty and demonstrate how it eases application development and supports a wide variety of application scenarios.},

The dynamic characteristics and sharing patterns of ad-hoc collaborative sharing impose a need for comprehensive and flexible approaches to reflect and cope with the unique access control requirements associated with the ad-hoc collaboration. In this paper, we propose a role-based access management framework to enable secure resource sharing,especially focusing on the digital information sharing in the heterogeneous scientific collaboration environments.Our framework incorporates role-based approach to address distributed access control, delegation and dissemination control involved in the resource sharing within such environments. A set of XACML-based policy schemas is proposed to specify policies on our framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of our framework, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system called ShareEnabler, which is based on a peer-to-peer information sharing toolkit developed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.},

abstract = {As an indispensable personalized service in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs), the next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to help people discover attractive and interesting places. Currently, most POI recommenders are based on the conventional centralized paradigm that heavily relies on the cloud to train the recommendation models with large volumes of collected users' sensitive check-in data. Although a few recent works have explored on-device frameworks for resilient and privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they invariably hold the assumption of model homogeneity for parameters/gradients aggregation and collaboration. However, users' mobile devices in the real world have various hardware configurations (e.g., compute resources), leading to heterogeneous on-device models with different architectures and sizes. In light of this, We propose a novel on-device POI recommendation framework, namely Model-Agnostic Collaborative learning for on-device POI recommendation (MAC), allowing users to customize their own model structures (e.g., dimension &amp; number of hidden layers). To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data, we propose to pre-select neighbors for collaboration based on physical distances, category-level preferences, and social networks. To assimilate knowledge from the above-selected neighbors in an efficient and secure way, we adopt the knowledge distillation framework with mutual information maximization. Instead of sharing sensitive models/gradients, clients in MAC only share their soft decisions on a preloaded reference dataset. To filter out low-quality neighbors, we propose two sampling strategies, performance-triggered sampling and similarity-based sampling, to speed up the training process and obtain optimal recommenders. In addition, we design two novel approaches to generate more effective reference datasets while protecting users' privacy. Extensive experiments on two datasets have shown the superiority of MAC over advanced baselines.},

Local workers can collaborate with remote helpers by sharing 360-degree live video or 3D virtual reconstruction of their surroundings. However, each of these techniques has benefits and drawbacks. In this paper we explore mixing 360 video and 3D reconstruction together for remote collaboration, by preserving benefits of both systems while reducing drawbacks of each. We developed a hybrid prototype and conducted user study to compare benefits and problems of using 360 or 3D alone to clarify the needs for mixing the two, and also to evaluate the prototype system. We found participants performed significantly better on collaborative search tasks in 360 and felt higher social presence, yet 3D also showed potential to complement. Participant feedback collected after trying our hybrid system provided directions for improvement.},

Therefore, the default effect and the role of the pair of users are the same, but in practice this may not be true. In addition, they only logically demonstrate the existence of a priority relationship between two users rather than the level of the relationship in practice. In this paper, we propose a new approach for the collaborative filtering based on the variation analysis of the implication index. An asymmetric measure is developed which can be used to rank or filter information based on the variation of the implication index by a counter-example. This measure provides a meaningful recommendation with a certain level of implication. Experimental results shown that the proposed approach can overcome the drawbacks in the traditional recommender systems.},

abstract = {Previous neural architecture search (NAS) approaches for mobile platforms have achieved great success in designing a slim-but-accurate neural network that is generally well-matched to a single computing unit such as a CPU or GPU. However, as recent mobile devices consist of multiple heterogeneous computing units, the next main challenge is to maximize both accuracy and efficiency by fully utilizing multiple available resources. We propose an ensemble-like approach with intermediate feature aggregations, namely synchronizations, for active collaboration between individual models on a mobile device. A main challenge is to determine the optimal synchronization strategies for achieving both performance and efficiency. To this end, we propose SyncNAS to automate the exploration of synchronization strategies for collaborative neural architectures that maximize utilization of heterogeneous computing units on a target device. We introduce a novel search space for synchronization strategy and apply Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm to improve the sampling efficiency and reduce the search cost. On ImageNet, our collaborative model based on MobileNetV2 achieves 2.7% top-1 accuracy improvement within the baseline latency budget. Under the reduced target latency down to half, our model maintains higher accuracy than its baseline model, owing to the enhanced utilization and collaboration. As an impact of MCTS, SyncNAS reduces its search cost by up to 21x in searching for the optimal strategy.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of two well-known, highly scalable factorized models: SVD++ and Asymmetric-SVD++. These are cutting-edge factorized models that have played a key role in the Netflix prize winner's solution. We first employ collaborative information to categorize the users and items. We then discover the shared interests between these categories. Including this new information, we extend these cutting-edge models regarding two main goals: 1) to improve their recommendation accuracies; 2) to keep the extended models still scalable. Finally, we evaluate our proposed models on two recommendation datasets: MovieLens100k, and Netflix. Our experiment shows that adding the shared interests among categories into these models improves their accuracy while maintaining scalability.},

We show how this approach enables analysts to appropriate available pertinent digital devices as they fluidly migrate between analytic phases or adopt different methods and representations, all while preserving consistent analysis artifacts.

Furthermore, we contribute to theory of designing for social play from the perspectives of co-located mobile contexts in game design by identifying how mobility: (1) affords co-locating with other players in public spaces, (2) supports physical interactions using spatial context and players bodies, extending games beyond their formal system, (3) supports asymmetric design with information and interaction. Finally we contribute the concept of a pocket magic circle, a particular magic circle, to support a focus on game design leveraging these intersecting properties.},

The literature has explored both synchronous and asynchronous transfer techniques, known as Handoff and Deposit, respectively. However, current cross-device environments tend to only provide a single mechanism. Moreover, we have little understanding of the impact of different techniques on collaborative process. To understand how Handoff and Deposit may be designed to support complex sensemaking tasks, we followed a Research through Design process to iteratively design Handoff and Deposit techniques using paper and digital sketches and high-fidelity prototypes. We consulted the HCI literature to corroborate our findings with studies and descriptions of existing cross-device transfer designs and to understand the potential impact of those designs on mixed-focus collaboration. We learned that as we move away from a restricted physical workspace and leverage the flexibility of digital personal devices, there is a large design space for realizing cross-device transfer. To inform these designs, we provide five design considerations for cross-device transfer techniques: Transfer Acceptance, Action Dependencies, Immediate Usability, Interruption Potential, and Connection Actions.},

It does this by connecting multiple single-display groupware workspaces together through a shared data structure. Our implementation and observations of MPG systems exposes two problems. The first is display disparity, where connecting heterogeneous tabletop and vertical displays introduces issues in how one seats people around the virtual table and how one orients work artifacts. The second is presence disparity, where a participant's perception of the presence of others is markedly different depending on whether a collaborator is co-located or remote. This is likely caused by inadequate consequential communication between remote participants, which in turn disrupts group collaborative and communication dynamics. To mitigate display and presence disparity problems, we determine virtual seating positions and replace conventional telepointers with digital arm shadows that extend from a person's side of the table to their pointer location.},

In this work, we explore issues and solutions in building heterogeneous co-editing systems, which allow multiple users to use different editors to edit shared documents in the same session. To drive our exploration, we built a prototype heterogeneous co-editing system, named CoVim+CoEmacs, which allows multiple users to use full functionalities and UI features of two comprehensive and rivalry text editors, Vim and Emacs, in the same co-editing session. In this paper, we focus on technical issues in designing and implementing heterogeneous co-editors in general and CoVim+CoEmacs in particular. We have motivated this work by potential usage benefits of heterogeneous co-editing systems and used working scenarios under the CoVim+CoEmacs prototype to illustrate some novel usages and inner workings of such systems, but left systematic user studies on heterogeneous co-editing to future work.

abstract = {Recent proliferation of computing devices has brought attention to heterogeneous collaborative systems, where key challenges arise from the resource limitations and disparities. Sharing data across disparate devices makes it necessary to employ mechanisms for adapting the original data and presenting it to the user in the best possible way. However, this could represent a major problem for effective collaboration, since users may find it difficult to reach consensus with everyone working with individually tailored data. This paper presents a novel approach to controlling the coupling of heterogeneous collaborative systems by combining concepts from complex systems and data adaptation techniques. The key idea is that data must be adapted to each individual's preferences and resource capabilities. To support and promote collaboration this adaptation must be interdependent, and adaptation performed by one individual should influence the adaptation of the others. These influences are defined according to the user's roles and collaboration requirements. We model the problem as a distributed optimization problem, so that the most useful data--both for the individual and the group as a whole--is scheduled for each user, while satisfying their preferences, their resource limitations, and their mutual influences. We show how this approach can be applied in a collaborative 3D design application and how it can be extended to other applications.},

abstract = {The Agile Manifesto emphasizes value on individuals and interactions over processes and tools, explicitly encouraging face-to-face communication as the most effective way of conveying information and collaboration between Agile teams. Effective collaboration enables teams to develop workable solutions to complex problems. However, in reality, this is continuously challenged by large, distributed teams, forcing communications in different directions. Towards the interest of (Collaborative Networked) Organizations in the adoption of emerging technologies to support communication and collaboration needs of their Distributed Agile and Adaptive Development Environment (DADE), we propose a DADE architecture based on the emerging Liquid Multi-Device Software paradigm. The evaluation of our LiquiDADE prototype showed that our approach is relevant and a valuable enhancement for improving agile development practices.},

Some cases are symmetric, in which users work together on equal footing, while others are asymmetric, in which one user may have more experience or capabilities than another (e.g., one may guide another in completing a task). We present a multi-user virtual reality system that supports interactions of both these types. Two collaborating users, whether co-located or remote, simultaneously manipulate the same virtual objects in a physics simulation, in tasks that require low latency networking to perform successfully. We are currently applying this approach to motor rehabilitation, in which a therapist and patient work together.},

abstract = {Image-text retrieval aims to bridge the modality gap and retrieve cross-modal content based on semantic similarities. Prior work usually focuses on the pairwise relations (i.e., whether a data sample matches another) but ignores the higher-order neighbor relations (i.e., a matching structure among multiple data samples). Re-ranking, a popular post-processing practice, has revealed the superiority of capturing neighbor relations in single-modality retrieval tasks. However, it is ineffective to directly extend existing re-ranking algorithms to image-text retrieval. In this paper, we analyze the reason from four perspectives, i.e., generalization, flexibility, sparsity, and asymmetry, and propose a novel learnable pillar-based re-ranking paradigm. Concretely, we first select top-ranked intra- and intermodal neighbors as pillars, and then reconstruct data samples with the neighbor relations between them and the pillars. In this way, each sample can be mapped into a multimodal pillar space only using similarities, ensuring generalization. After that, we design a neighbor-aware graph reasoning module to flexibly exploit the relations and excavate the sparse positive items within a neighborhood. We also present a structure alignment constraint to promote crossmodal collaboration and align the asymmetric modalities. On top of various base backbones, we carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrating the effectiveness, superiority, generalization, and transferability of our proposed re-ranking paradigm.},

To do this, we developed eyemR-Vis, a 360 panoramic Mixed Reality remote collaboration system that shows gaze behavioural cues as bi-directional spatial virtual visualisations shared between a local host and a remote collaborator. Preliminary results from an exploratory study indicate that using virtual cues to visualise gaze behaviour has the potential to increase co-presence, improve gaze awareness, encourage collaboration, and is inclined to be less physically demanding or mentally distracting.},

The preliminary results indicate that the interface with the partner’s communication cues visualised close to the gaze point allows users to focus without dividing attention to the collaborator’s physical body movements yet still effectively communicate. Shared gaze visualisations coupled with deictic languages are primarily used to affirm joint attention and mutual understanding, while hand pointing and gesturing are used as secondary. Our approach provides a new way to help enable effective remote collaboration through varied empathic communication visualisations and modalities which covers different task properties and spatial setups.},

abstract = {The Virtual Notebook Environment (ViNE) is a platform-independent, web-based interface designed to support a range of scientific activities across distributed, heterogeneous computing platforms. ViNE provides scientists with a web-based version of the common paper-based lab notebook, but in addition, it provides support for collaboration and management of computational experiments. Collaboration is supported with the web-based approach, which makes notebook material generally accessible and with a hierarchy of security mechanisms that screen that access. ViNE provides uniform, system-transparent access to data, tools, and programs throughout the scientist's computing infrastructure. Computational experiments can be launched from ViNE using a visual specification language. The scientist is freed from concerns about inter-tool connectivity, data distribution, or data management details. ViNE also provides support for dynamically linking analysis results back into the notebook content.In this paper we present the ViNE system architecture and a case study of its use in neuropsychology research at the University of Oregon. Our case study with the Brain Electrophysiology Laboratory (BEL) addresses their need for data security and management, collaborative support, and distributed analysis processes. The current version of ViNE is a prototype system being tested with this and other scientific applications.},

abstract = {In this era of smart devices, new technologies, gadgets, apps, and numerous systems and services available over online, teaching an introductory programming course by traditional lecture method faces challenges to draw student's attention; especially in their freshman year. In this work, we discuss our experience in teaching an introductory CS course by infusing both interactive and collaborative learning in pedagogy so that students can learn using interactive platforms, tools, technologies, systems, and services as available to them and collaboration within and among groups. For interactive learning, students used an interactive programming environment (e.g. repl.it classroom) as well as online eBooks. We designed several in-class exercises, assignments, small lab-based projects with example codes and expected outputs, and unit tests by using built-in unit tests library. We also, in the middle of semester, introduced collaborative learning through teamwork on well-defined projects during the learning time and submitted at the end. The collaborations include use of basic task management tools and multi-player tool of repl.it that the students can critic, supplement, improve peer works and learn. To evaluate the impact of this infusion, a pre- and post-survey were conducted on student cohort in two different semesters. The initial evaluation of the survey results and performances (final project and final grades) show evidence to conclude that the proposed pedagogical approach increased student motivation and engagement and facilitated learning to entry-level computer science students.},

Tabletops and other dedicated interactive surface devices with direct input and tangible interaction can enhance remote collaboration, and open up new interaction scenarios based on mixed physical/virtual components. However, they are only available to a small subset of users, as they usually require identical bespoke hardware for every participant, are complex to setup, and need custom scenario-specific applications. We present SurfaceCast, a software toolkit designed to merge multiple distributed, heterogeneous end-user devices into a single, shared mixed-reality surface. Supported devices include regular desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mixed-reality headsets, as well as projector-camera setups and dedicated interactive tabletop systems. This device-agnostic approach provides a fundamental building block for exploration of a far wider range of usage scenarios than previously feasible, including future clients using our provided API. In this paper, we present various example application scenarios which we enhance through the multi-user and multi-device features of the framework. Our results show that the hardware- and content-agnostic architecture of SurfaceCast can run on a wide variety of devices with sufficient performance and fidelity for real-time interaction.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) aims to train high-quality models in collaboration with distributed clients while not uploading their local data, which attracts increasing attention in both academia and industry. However, there is still a considerable gap between the flourishing FL research and real-world scenarios, mainly caused by the characteristics of heterogeneous devices and its scales. Most existing works conduct evaluations with homogeneous devices, which are mismatched with the diversity and variability of heterogeneous devices in real-world scenarios. Moreover, it is challenging to conduct research and development at scale with heterogeneous devices due to limited resources and complex software stacks. These two key factors are important yet underexplored in FL research as they directly impact the FL training dynamics and final performance, making the effectiveness and usability of FL algorithms unclear. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable prototyping system for real-world cross-device FL, FS-REAL. It supports heterogeneous device runtime, contains parallelism and robustness enhanced FL server, and provides implementations and extensibility for advanced FL utility features such as personalization, communication compression and asynchronous aggregation. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of FS-REAL, we conduct extensive experiments with various device distributions, quantify and analyze the effect of the heterogeneous device and various scales, and further provide insights and open discussions about real-world FL scenarios. Our system is released to help to pave the way for further real-world FL research and broad applications involving diverse devices and scales.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have been explored by researchers for nearly a half century. Over the past few years, however, VR has experienced a renaissance, as head-worn display developer kits have metamorphosed into early consumer products, all far superior to what most VR researchers previously had available. Meanwhile, AR head-worn display developer kits are being released, even as Pok\'{e}mon Go has caused public awareness of hand-held AR to skyrocket.What role will wireless computing play in the future of wearable VR and AR systems? I will suggest some of the ways in which future wearable hardware, software, and user interfaces could benefit from wireless technology, and describe some of the performance constraints that wireless systems must meet for this to be possible. For example, in the quest to develop lightweight eyewear, it will be advantageous to move as much technology as possible off the head, to other parts of the body or to the nearby environment. This will demand reliably low latency and high throughput for the asymmetric round trip from head-worn sensors, to off-head processors, back to head-worn displays. Furthermore, when AR eyewear becomes commonplace, so will multi-user AR collaboration, and that means handling intricate interactions between users, both co-located and remote.},

To address this, we set out to design a collaborative story mapping tool with a group of children with mixed visual abilities and their teaching assistants. Using co-design approaches over ten workshops, we designed and prototyped different ideas for engaging children in storytelling and design. We present our co-design process and findings, and the resulting story mapping system. We outline how using multisensory elements can facilitate creativity and collaboration to help children with mixed visual abilities create and share stories together, and support learning and social inclusion of VI children in mainstream classrooms.},

However, they are only available to a small subset of users, as they usually require identical bespoke hardware for every participant, are complex to setup, and need custom scenario-specific applications.  

 We present SurfaceCast, a software toolkit designed to merge multiple distributed, heterogeneous end-user devices into a single, shared mixed-reality surface. Supported devices include regular desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and mixed-reality headsets, as well as projector-camera setups and dedicated interactive tabletop systems.  
 This device-agnostic approach provides a fundamental building block for exploration of a far wider range of usage scenarios than previously feasible, including future clients using our provided API.  

 In this paper, we discuss the software architecture of SurfaceCast, present a formative user study and a quantitative performance analysis of our framework, and introduce five example application scenarios which we enhance through the multi-user and multi-device features of the framework.  
 Our results show that the hardware- and content-agnostic architecture of SurfaceCast can run on a wide variety of devices with sufficient performance and fidelity for real-time interaction.},

abstract = {This demonstration shows eyemR-Vis, a 360 panoramic Mixed Reality collaboration system that translates gaze behavioural cues to bi-directional visualisations between a local host (AR) and a remote collaborator (VR). The system is designed to share dynamic gaze behavioural cues as bi-directional spatial virtual visualisations between a local host and a remote collaborator. This enables richer communication of gaze through four visualisation techniques: browse, focus, mutual-gaze, and fixated circle-map. Additionally, our system supports simple bi-directional avatar interaction as well as panoramic video zoom. This makes interaction in the normally constrained remote task space more flexible and relatively natural. By showing visual communication cues that are physically inaccessible in the remote task space through reallocating and visualising the existing ones, our system aims to provide a more engaging and effective remote collaboration experience.},

abstract = {Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) can support interdisciplinary, heterogeneous geographically distributed creative teams. However research and commercial approaches to CVEs to support creative work have focused on implementation, paying little attention to the design of the virtual place that the system creates.Over the last ten years CVEs have moved out of the lab and into mass-market commercial deployment. Significant investment in virtual worlds (perhaps half a billion dollars in 2008 [3]) has seen technical advances, but the design of the virtual places has not advanced in a comparable manner. Just as in 1998, they still default to the Virtual Office, with avatars on chairs facing a virtual presentation screen.I am developing a set of design principles for virtual collaborative place, through a process of iterative design. In this process, five draft principles have been derived from existing theories of collaboration and creative place, and from exploratory ethnographic enquiries into real and virtual creative places [4].The draft design principles are: 1. Support Reconfiguration, 2. Mix Realities, 3. Control Access, 4. Be A/Synchronous, 5. Transform Space into Inhabited Place.Now I am expressing the principles in prototypes which will be introduced into the environments of working distributed creative teams in a programme of action research.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) is a diverse collection of principles
and practices aimed at making technologies and social institutions
more responsive to human needs. The central tenet of PD is the
direct involvement of people in the codesign of the systems they
use. Originally viewed as an approach to developing computer
systems for specific groups of workers, PD has expanded outwards in
philosophical, political and pragmatic ways. It is now part of an
emerging movement that blurs theoretical and practical boundaries
and integrates work from many disciplines -- in an artful way --
all in pursuit of relevance for people around the world shaping
their own 'networked society.'The Participatory Design Conferences have been convened every
two years since 1990. These forums have brought together a
multidisciplinary and international group of software developers,
researchers, social scientists, designers, activists,
practitioners, users, citizens, cultural workers and managers who
adopt distinctively participatory approaches in the development of
information and communication artifacts, systems, services and
technology.Participatory design approaches have been used in traditional
application domains (such as computer systems for business, health
care and government) and are also relevant in emerging areas such
as web-portal design, e-government services, community networks,
enterprise resource planning, public CSCW (computer supported
cooperative work) systems, social administration, community
development, university/community partnerships, tele-health,
political deliberation/mobilization (e-democracy), digital arts and
design, scholarship and teaching with mediated technologies
(e-learning), cultural production and cultural institutions. PD is
also being used in the development of ICT (information and
communication technology) infrastructures like free software/open
source projects, standards, protocols, new media, policy, broadband
and WiFi (wireless fidelity) networks and the like.Participatory designers of ICT-applications may learn from, and,
hopefully contribute to, work in other fields, such as community
and organizational development, architecture, urban planning,
policy development, media, design and art, especially insofar as
these fields increasingly use ICTs. Participatory design approaches
can be applied in various social settings such as local
communities, government agencies, civil society, NGOs, schools and
universities, companies, trade unions, etc. each with its own
distinctive stakeholder arenas and power relations.Artful IntegrationThe overall theme of the 2004 conference, "Artful Integration:
Interweaving Media, Materials and Practices" describes a central
reality of participatory design. It recognizes that an essential
ingredient in design practice is the working together of multiple,
heterogeneous elements. Whereas conventional design approaches
emphasize the role of the designer and the creation of singular 'things', artful integration calls attention to the collective
interweaving of people, artifacts and processes to achieve
practical, aesthetic or emancipatory syntheses. With that in mind
the conference organizers inaugurated the "Artful Integrators
Award" to recognize exemplary work in participatory design.The award is intended to recognize outstanding achievement in
the area of participatory design of information and communications
technologies. The award goes to a group of people who together have
worked out, in an exceptionally creative way, a new and useful
configuration of technologies and practices. Where traditional
design awards have gone to individual designers or singular
objects, the Artful Integrators Award emphasizes the importance of
collaborative participation in design, and a view of good design as
the effective alignment of diverse collections of people,
activities and artifacts. While no single element of the design
might be particularly extraordinary in itself, the combination of
design process and outcome can be.The Artful Integrators Award 2004 goes to Randy Trigg and the
Global Fund for Women. Through their ongoing project of
participatory design, Randy and his organization have created an
information and communications infrastructure that exemplifies, in
process and products, the spirit of the Artful Integration Award.
As an accomplished software developer and systems integrator,
Randy's collaboration with members of the Fund has resulted in the
design of a database system for nonprofits that brings together
fundraising, grant making and human resource management in ways
that accommodate the continually evolving work practices of the
organization. The Global Fund's developing infrastructure weaves
together Randy's longstanding commitment to cooperative design
practices with the Global Fund's commitment to democratic forms of
wealth redistribution. Receiving the Award with Randy is Kavita
Ramdas, President and CEO of the Global Fund for Women, who will
speak about the Fund's grant making philosophy and participatory
practices.Research PapersThis Volume collects the research papers presented at PDC2004.
They are organized in three broad areas, corresponding to the main
tracks within the conference. The first track deals with
participatory design in various community contexts, reflecting the
recent growth of interest in this emerging area. The other two are
more traditional, dealing with methodological considerations and
reflections on case experiences respectively. Within the tracks,
the papers appear in the order of their presentation at the
conference.A word about the reviewing process for the research papers. We
were very pleased at the enthusiastic response to the call for
papers. We received 63 papers from people in over a dozen
countries. Each paper was double-blind reviewed by at least three
reviewers, coordinated through an online system custom built for
this purpose. At a meeting in Toronto the program committee
considered all the reviews, and selected 23 papers for
presentation, providing authors with comments reflected in the
revised papers you find here.Other Conference ContributionsA highlight of any conference are the keynote addresses by
invited speakers. At PDC2004 we are proud that three distinguished
scholars are sharing their insights with us: Tone Bratteteig, a PD
pioneer and associate professor in the Department of Informatics,
University of Oslo, speaks on "Participatory Design in Present
Society," highlighting the challenges posed by such developments as
the globalization of organizations and work processes. Reinhard
Keil-Slawik, a professor of Informatics and Society in the Heinz
Nixdorf Institute, University of Paderborn., considers fundamental
product/process tensions in his talk "Participation in the Age of
Digital Media". The conference closes with Jonathan Barker,
professor emeritus of the University of Toronto, speaking on
"Fearful Asymmetry: Terror, Power, and the Shape of Popular
Action", in which he addresses the contemporary political context
in which PD practitioners will likely need to take heed.In addition to the research papers and keynote speakers, PDC
2004 convenes a diverse collection of other events. These include
short papers (research works in progress, field experiences /
stories from reflective practitioners, tools and techniques
reports), preconference workshops, conference workshops, artifacts,
posters, interactive demonstrations, art installations, and
tutorials. These are described in Volume II of the proceedings. In
addition, for the first time, we convene a Doctoral Consortium.

abstract = {Bodily play, which is a productive social interaction for bonding social relationships, has positive impacts on self-efficacy, acute cognitive benefit, and emotion. However, most bodily play encourages players to enjoy their own experiences. There are limited researches on sharing players' perspectives to enhance players' empathy for understanding others. Thus, we propose an asymmetric two-person game in an immersive environment. This bodily play, which supports perspective-taking via the integration with the first- and second-perspectives, has a collaborative interface that allows users to share their physiological and emotional perspectives. Initial testing of the system shows that players can not only understand well the feeling and problems encountered by each other through sharing perspectives and information but also increases the social closeness of players and stimulates empathy after the interplay.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been an introduction of sophisticated new video conferencing technologies (e.g., HP Halo, Cisco Telepresence) that have led to enhancements in the collaborative user experience over traditional video conferencing technologies. Traditional video conferencing set-ups often distort the shared spatial properties of action and communication due to screen and camera orientation disparities and other asymmetries. These distortions affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize action and communication. By contrast, new systems, such as Halo, are physically configured to reduce these asymmetries and orientation disparities, thereby minimizing these spatial distortions. By creating appropriate shared spatial geometries, the distributed spaces become “blended” where the spatial geometries of the local space continue coherently across the distributed boundary into the remote site, providing the illusion of a single unified space. Drawing on theories of embodied action and workplace design we discuss the importance of this geometric “blending” of space for distributed collaboration and how this is achieved in systems such as Halo. We then extend these arguments to explore the concept of Blended Interaction Spaces: blended spaces in which interactive groupware is incorporated in ways spatially consistent with the physical geometries of the video-mediated set-up. We illustrate this discussion through a system called BISi that introduces interactive horizontal and vertical multipoint surfaces into a blended video-mediated collaboration space. In presenting this system, we highlight some of the particular challenges of creating these systems arising from the spatial consequences of different interaction mechanisms (e.g., direct touch or remote control) and how they affect movement and spatial configuration of people in these spaces.},

Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems offer tools to support these collective activities. The method used to form the learners groups can be a key element in achieving a successful collaboration. This paper proposes a method of group formation using indicators that analyze previous collaborative activities of the learners. This method is based on data depth, a statistical tool that allows the ordering of multivariate data. In the process, the data depth of the analysis indicators of each learner is calculated, providing a measure that compares the values of the indicators of each learner with those of other learners. Thus, the method allows us to group learners whose analysis indicators register similar or different values. In this way, a flexible approach for forming homogeneous or heterogeneous groups is offered. We develop a software tool for this method, which we use in a case study to form groups of learners who work on programming tasks using a CSCL system.},

abstract = {In large distributed corporations, distributed design review offers the potential for cost savings, reduced time to market, and improved efficiency. It also has the potential to improve the design process by enabling wider expertise to be incorporated in design reviews. This paper describes the integration of several components to enable distributed virtual design review in mixed multi-party, heterogeneous multi-site 2D and immersive 3D environments. The system provides higher layers of support for collaboration including avatars, high fidelity audio, and shared artifact manipulation. The system functions across several interface environments ranging from CAVEs to Walls to desktop workstations. At the center of the software architecture is the Human Integrating Virtual Environment (HIVE) [6], a collaboration infrastructure and toolset to support research and development of multi-user, geographically distributed, 2D and 3D shared applications. The HIVE functions with VisualEyes software for visualizing 3D data in virtual environments. We also describe in detail the configuration and lessons learned in a two site, heterogeneous multi-user demonstration of the system between HRL Laboratories in Malibu, California and GM R&amp;D in Warren, Michigan.},

We report on a globally distributed project course between the University of Victoria, Canada and Aalto University, Finland. The project-driven course involved 16 students in Canada and 9 students in Finland, divided into three cross-site Scrum teams working on a single large project. To assess learning of GSE competencies we employed a mixed-method approach including 13 post-course interviews, pre-, post-course and iteration questionnaires, observations, recordings of Daily Scrums as well as collection of project asynchronous communication data. Our analysis indicates that the Scrum method, along with supporting collaboration practices and tools, supports the learning of important GSE competencies, such as distributed communication and teamwork, building and maintaining trust, using appropriate collaboration tools, and inter-cultural collaboration.},

Multiagent Quality-Diversity methods partially address this problem by filtering the joint space of policies to smaller sub-spaces that make the diversification of agent policies tractable. However, in teams of asymmetric agents (agents with different objectives and capabilities), the search for diversity is primarily driven by the need to find policies that will allow agents to assume complementary roles required to work together in teams. This work introduces Asymmetric Island Model (AIM), a multiagent framework that enables populations of asymmetric agents to learn diverse complementary policies that foster teamwork via dynamic population size allocation on a wide variety of team tasks. The key insight of AIM is that the competitive pressure arising from the distribution of policies on different team-wide tasks drives the agents to explore regions of the policy space that yield specializations that generalize across tasks. Simulation results on multiple variations of a remote habitat problem highlight the strength of AIM in discovering robust synergies that allow agents to operate near-optimally in response to the changing team composition and policies of other agents.},

abstract = {Despite the growth of Virtual Reality (VR), the design space of collocated social play in VR remains narrow. Here we present Astaire, a collaborative hybrid VR dance game for two players sharing an HTC Vive VR system. The game resulted from a design research process using embodied design methods, and drawing upon concepts in HCI and Play Design, including social affordances, and asymmetric and interdependent play. Here we present insights from a study playtesting Astaire alongside two VR games that inspired ours: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (KTNE), and Audioshield. We examined players' and spectators' enjoyment, and interpersonal relationships, which were self-reported higher for Astaire. Using data from semi-structured interviews, we foreground design elements that impacted our participants' play experience, grouped under the themes of balance of players' roles, the physicality afforded by the game, and the social experience enabled. Our work contributes to opening the design space of hybrid collocated VR--through our game, we surface inspirational design concepts in HCI, and share design knowledge gained during our design process.},

abstract = {It has been widely recognized that one of the keys to cost reduction and service improvement in national health care lies in the integration of medical information system. Integration of information can not only improve care delivery today, but it can also help build research bases to enhance future care delivery. The question is how to achieve such integration? Imposing a single client software solution or common clinical terminology does not appear likely to happen. That lack of single software solutions and common terminologies means that solutions to integrate medical information will have to use, and somehow solve, the many heterogeneous data sources that currently exist. We believe the GRID computing paradigm has the potential to provide viable solutions to this problem. In collaboration with researchers in Health Information Science and practitioners in Health Care, we have developed a prototype for the Health Information Grid, a middleware technology that supports inexpensive mediation of medical information among rapidly evolving, heterogeneous medical information sources. This paper makes three main contributions: (1) it discusses issues and requirements arising from constructing a global health information network in Canada from a software engineering point of view, (2) it presents the concepts of a technology developed to address these issues, and (3) it presents a prototype of this technology along with a case study developed in collaboration with domain experts and practitioners.},

By using small-size programmable hardware and wearable sensors, any display device (referred to as display surface) can act as a thin client for users to interact with the different remote devices. Under a flexible system architecture for local and remote devices' communication and collaboration, several techniques, such as adaptive screen compression, interactive ROI control, and accelerometer-based pointing input, are developed to improve the system performance and user experience. Evaluations show that the proposed system can efficiently utilize the remote computing resources and local display capabilities of ubiquitous devices, which will greatly benefit interactive multimedia applications.},

In this paper, we report on a 360° panoramic Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration system that shares gaze behaviour visualisations between a local user in Augmented Reality and a remote collaborator in Virtual Reality. We conducted two user studies to evaluate the design of MR gaze interfaces and the effect of gaze behaviour (on/off) and gaze style (bi-/uni-directional). The results indicate that gaze visualisations amplify meaningful joint attention and improve co-presence compared to a no gaze condition. Gaze behaviour visualisations enable communication to be less verbally complex therefore lowering collaborators' cognitive load while improving mutual understanding. Users felt that bi-directional behaviour visualisation, showing both collaborator's gaze state, was the preferred condition since it enabled easy identification of shared interests and task progress.},

IMRCE is a lightweight, flexible, and robust Unity toolkit that allows designers and researchers to rapidly prototype mixed reality-mixed presence (MR-MP) environments that connect physical spaces, virtual spaces, and devices. IMRCE helps collaborators maintain group awareness of the shared collaborative environment by providing visual cues such as position indicators and virtual hands. At the same time IMRCE provides flexibility in how physical and virtual spaces are mapped, allowing work environments to be optimised for each collaborator while maintaining a sense of integration. The main contribution of the toolkit is its encapsulation of these features, allowing rapid development of MR-MP systems. We demonstrate IMRCE's features by linking a physical environment with tabletop and wall displays to a virtual replica augmented with support for direct 3D manipulation of shared work objects. We also conducted a comparative evaluation of IMRCE against a standard set of Unity libraries with complementary features with 10 developers, and found significant reductions in time taken, total LOC, errors, and requests for assistance.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) enables distributed mobile devices to collaboratively learn a shared model without exposing their raw data. However, heterogeneous devices usually have limited and different available resources, i.e., system heterogeneity, for model training and communicating, while the diverse data distribution among devices, i.e., data heterogeneity, may result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose TailorFL, a dual-personalized FL framework, which tailors a submodel for each device with personalized structure for training and personalized parameters for local inference. To achieve this, we first excavate the personalization principle for data heterogeneous FL via in-depth empirical studies, and based on which, we propose a resource-aware and data-directed pruning strategy that makes each device's submodel structure match its resource capability and correlate with its local data distribution. To aggregate the submodels while preserving their dual personalization properties, we design a scaling-based aggregation strategy that scales parameters with the pruning rate of submodels and aggregates the overlapped parameters. Moreover, to further promote beneficial and restrain detrimental collaborations among devices, we propose a server-assisted model-tuning mechanism, which dynamically tunes device's submodel structure at the server side with the global view of device's data distribution similarities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to the status quo approaches, TailorFL achieves an average of 22% increase in inference accuracy, and reduces the memory, computation, and communication costs for model training simultaneously.},

abstract = {Large IT organizations depend on a global software delivery model which involves large teams with various roles and stakeholders. As software delivery is inherently collaborative, it requires the different roles to share artifacts, knowledge and insights with each other throughout the delivery life-cycle. Typically, each role has different insight and understanding needs, based on her/his context and activities. An architect may need to understand the system from a modularity perspective, a developer from code quality purposes, whereas a tester would need to understand it from a user-triggered flow perspective. However, the way we represent, understand, and collaborate on software artefacts, is still limited by the confines of traditional 2D computer screens. In this paper, we present our early work of an Extended Reality (XR) based approach that leverages affordances of natural human perception to represent and visualize software applications in three dimensions. This immersive approach is aimed at becoming a common fabric across global delivery roles, making activities like application comprehension, architecture analysis, knowledge communication, and analysis of a software's dynamic aspects, more contextual, richer, and intuitive. We posit that the use of XR, specifically augmented/mixed reality-based multidimensional views of different software artefacts, can be adapted to be an intuitive bridge across different roles, and foster a novel way of collaboration (both locally and globally). Here, we present our immersive approach and its prototype implementation, along with examples of its usage by different project roles. We also discuss some early feedback and the way forward.},

For this reason, we present CIDER, a system for the collaborative editing of 3D augmented scenes allowing two or more users to manipulate the virtual scene elements independently and without unexpected changes. CIDER is based on the use of "layers" encapsulating the state of the environment with private layers that can be edited independently and a global one collaboratively updated with "commit" operations. Using this system, implemented for the HoloLens 2 headsets and supporting multiple users, we performed a user test on a realistic interior design task, evaluating the general usability and comparing two different approaches for the management of the atomic commit: forced (single-phase) and voting (requiring consensus), analyzing the effects of this choice on the collaborative behavior.},

abstract = {Since it can effectively address the problem of sparsity and cold start of collaborative filtering, knowledge graph (KG) is widely studied and employed as side information in the field of recommender systems. However, most of existing KG-based recommendation methods mainly focus on how to effectively encode the knowledge associations in KG, without highlighting the crucial collaborative signals which are latent in user-item interactions. As such, the learned embeddings underutilize the two kinds of pivotal information and are insufficient to effectively represent the latent semantics of users and items in vector space.In this paper, we propose a novel method named Collaborative Knowledge-aware Attentive Network (CKAN) which explicitly encodes the collaborative signals by collaboration propagation and proposes a natural way of combining collaborative signals with knowledge associations together. Specifically, CKAN employs a heterogeneous propagation strategy to explicitly encode both kinds of information, and applies a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to discriminate the contribution of different knowledge-based neighbors. Compared with other KG-based methods, CKAN provides a brand-new idea of combining collaborative information with knowledge information together. We apply the proposed model on four real-world datasets, and the empirical results demonstrate that CKAN significantly outperforms several compelling state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Large-scale micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) swarms provide promising solutions for situational awareness in applications such as environmental monitoring, urban surveillance, search and rescue, and so on. However, these scenarios do not provide localization infrastructure and limit cost and size of on-board capabilities of individual nodes, which makes it challenging for nodes to autonomously navigate to suitable preassigned locations. In this article, we present H-DrunkWalk, a collaborative and adaptive technique for heterogeneous MAV swarm navigation in environments not formerly preconditioned for operation. Working with heterogeneous MAV swarm, the H-DrunkWalk achieves high accuracy through collaboration but still maintains a low cost of the entire swarm. The heterogeneous MAV swarm consists of two types of nodes: (1) basic MAVs with limited sensing, communication, computing capabilities and (2) advanced MAVs with premium sensing, communication, computing capabilities. The key focus behind this networked MAV swarm research is to (1) rely on collaboration to overcome limitations of individual nodes and efficiently achieve system-wide sensing objectives and (2) fully take advantage of advanced MAVs to help basic MAVs improve their performance. The evaluations based on real MAV testbed experiments and large-scale physical-feature-based simulations show that compared to the traditional non-collaborative and non-adaptive method (dead reckoning with map bias), our system achieves up to 6\texttimes{} reductions in location estimation errors, and as much as 3\texttimes{} improvements in navigation success rate under the given time and accuracy constraints. In addition, by comprehensively considering the environment, heterogeneous structure, and quality of location estimation, our H-DrunkWalk brings 2\texttimes{} performance improvement (on average) as that of a hardware upgrade.},

Mighty Mouse is a novel groupware tool built on the public domain VNC protocol. It is tailored specifically for face-to-face collaboration where multiple heterogeneous computers (usually laptops) are viewed simultaneously (usually via projectors) by people working together on a variety of applications under various operating systems. Mighty Mouse uses only the remote input capability of VNC, but enhances this with various features to support flexible movement between the various platforms, "floor control" to facilitate smooth collaboration, and customization features to accommodate different user, platform, and application preferences in a relatively seamless manner. The design rationale arises from specific observations about how people collaborate in meetings, which allows certain simplifying assumptions to be made in the implementation.},

These systems try to achieve a sense of co-presence in order to promote fluid collaboration, yet it can be unclear how actions made in one location are manifested in the other. This ambiguity makes it difficult to share sensitive information with confidence, impacting the fluidity of the shared experience. In this paper, we focus on mixed reality approaches (blending physical and virtual spaces) for mixed presence collaboration. We present SecSpace, our software toolkit for usable privacy and security research in mixed reality collaborative environments. SecSpace permits privacy-related actions in either physical or virtual space to generate effects simultaneously in both spaces. These effects will be the same in terms of their impact on privacy but they may be functionally tailored to suit the requirements of each space. We detail the architecture of SecSpace and present three prototypes that illustrate the flexibility and capabilities of our approach.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) systems have advanced greatly in the past few years, especially with the support of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions. Numerous AI-supported IoT devices are playing a significant role in providing complex and user-specific smart city services. Given the multitude of heterogeneous wireless networks, the plethora of computer and storage architectures and paradigms, and the abundance of mobile and vehicular IoT devices, true smart city experiences are only attainable through a cooperative intelligent and secure IoT framework. This article provides an extensive study on different cooperative systems and envisions a cooperative solution that supports the integration and collaboration among both centralized and distributed systems, in which intelligent AI-supported IoT devices such as smart UAVs provide support in the data collection, processing and service provisioning process. Moreover, secure and collaborative decentralized solutions such as Blockchain are considered in the service provisioning process to enable enhanced privacy and authentication features for IoT applications. As such, user-specific complex services and applications within smart city environments will be delivered and made available in a timely, secure, and efficient manner.},

abstract = {Real-time collaborative programming and non-real-time collaborative programming are two classes of methods and techniques for supporting programmers to jointly conduct complex programming work in software development. They are complementary to each other, and both are useful and effective under different programming circumstances. However, most existing programming tools and environments have been designed for supporting only one of them, and little has been done to provide integrated support for both. In this paper, we contribute a novel Any-Time Collaborative Programming Environment (ATCoPE) to seamlessly integrate conventional non-real-time collaborative programming tools and environments with emerging real-time collaborative programming techniques and support collaborating programmers to work in and flexibly switch among different collaboration modes according to their needs. We present the general design objectives for ATCoPE, the system architecture, functional design and specifications, rationales beyond design decisions, and major technical issues and solutions in detail, as well as a proof-of-concept implementation of the ATCoEclipse prototype system.},

The first algorithm relies on the exchange of information about a transaction instance, whereas the second algorithm uses qualitative information provided by individual agents, such as the results of predictions from the agent\'{y}s local perspective. We apply the architecture and strategies to a distributed supply chain prediction problem. Experiments run on a large real-world order data set indicate that our approach effectively improves the learning performance based on limited additional communication between the participating agents.},

abstract = {Large, high-resolution displays are highly suitable for creation of digital environments for co-located collaborative task solving. Yet, placing multiple users in a shared environment may increase the risk of interferences, thus causing mental discomfort and decreasing efficiency of the team. To mitigate interferences coordination strategies and techniques were introduced. However, in a mixed-focus collaboration scenarios users switch now and again between loosely and tightly collaboration, therefore different coordination techniques might be required depending on the current collaboration state of team members. For that, systems have to be able to recognize collaboration states as well as transitions between them to ensure a proper adjustment of the coordination strategy. Previous studies on group behavior during collaboration in front of large displays investigated solely collaborative coupling states, not transitions between them though. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 12 participant dyads in front of a tiled display and let them solve two tasks in two different conditions (focus and overview). We looked into group dynamics and categorized transitions by means of changes in proximity, verbal communication, visual attention, visual interface, and gestures. The findings can be valuable for user interface design and development of group behavior models.},

abstract = {Asymmetric cryptography brings the ability for anyone on earth to check the signature of a digital object (Diffie &amp; Hellman, 1976). From that perspective, trusted timestamping of a digital object provides very strong evidence of its author or inventor and integrity (Haber, 1991). 26 years later, one might have expected that trusted timestamping would have long ago replaced traditional paper laboratory notebooks, which has not happened yet. In this paper, we argue that the reason is that authenticity is a document process: while trusted timestamping remains a necessary part of the process, a digital object must be involved in a sociotechnical process in order to become a document. We first point out the gap, intractable with paper, between the strict administrative workflow required to create strong evidence, and the fluidity of collaborative authoring needed for creativity. This gap is relevant to laboratory notebooks, as they are commonly used by inventors to attest that they discovered elements at a specific time, in a specific context. Then we explain the design and implementation of our software system, according to document theory (Buckland, 1997), in order to reinvent the whole process to minimize the administrative burden, while preserving its well-known and valuable properties.},

abstract = {In any collaborative system, people do not contribute equally. This is particularly observed to be true for systems seeking to gather contributions from a large, diverse group of people. In such settings, it is seen that a sizable amount of contribution comes from a small group of highly-active users. While it is well-understood that such users are instrumental in the system's progress, the contribution made by a large group of less-active users is not sufficiently understood. Popularly called masses, these users comprise of the majority of the system's user base. It is, therefore, important to examine their worth in the system. The literature in this direction points towards two contradicting points of view with one acknowledging masses' contribution (Ortega Hypothesis) while the other deeming them unnecessary in the system (Newton Hypothesis). Given the large-scale collaboration facilitated by Wikipedia where a large crowd with a diverse skill-set and hence unequal contribution participates, a detailed investigation of the worth of masses becomes necessary for informed policy-making.In this work, we examine whether masses help or hamper the knowledge-building in Wikipedia. We specifically consider their contribution across different contribution types pertaining to the insertion of new content as well as the administrative activities. We observe that although the individual contribution by masses is small, yet they contribute important pieces of knowledge to Wikipedia articles. The results indicate that the overall contribution of masses across several parameters even exceeds the contribution by elites. We also find that as compared to masses, highly-active users dominate the edits where no new content is inserted and only activities involving the up-keeping of the existing content such as restructuring or formatting take place. The results of the study may help in devising appropriate incentivization policies for Wikipedia and the collaborative systems in general.},

First, a tele-immersive system offers end users an unmatched realistic and immersive experience by allowing them to collaborate in the joint virtual space. Second, the human activities in the shared space are not limited to the conferencing conversation. In this paper, we conduct a user study with 19 participants to investigate the human perceptions of two tele-immersive shared activities, where media samples of different qualities are evaluated using the comparative category rating method [9] in case of each activity. We compare our subjective results to those presented in G.1070, and demonstrate heterogeneous human perceptual impacts in different activities.},

abstract = {The inference workload redistribution is a technique for evacuating inference requests from hot edges to idle edges in edge collaborative systems, thereby achieving inference workload balancing for inference on different edges. However, with the continuous development of edge accelerators, the resource utilization of edge accelerators in executing inference requests in series is often low, and when executing multiple inference requests in parallel, it faces uncertain execution delays, different response-time Service Level Objectives (SLOs), and the generality of inference workloads in heterogeneous edge collaborative systems. To address these issues, for the first time in the domain of inference workload redistribution, we propose a Batch-aware Inference workload Redistribution and Parallel execution scheme, called BIRP, to reduce the additional latency caused by waiting for a single inference task during serial execution, thereby improving the overall inference accuracy. BIRP uses the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithm to adjust hyperparameters of the Throughput Improvement Ratio (TIR) function online for improving the overall inference accuracy. For nonlinear terms in the problem, BIRP uses a piecewise linear approximation to convert it into a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, ensuring the effectiveness of BIRP in theory. We prototype BIRP on an edge collaborative system composed of three heterogeneous edges. Based on real inference workload trace, we validate the superiority of our algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art model selection-based inference workload redistribution algorithm, with an overall inference loss reduction of at least 32.9% and the failure rate of SLO has been reduced to 19.8% of alternatives.},

abstract = {Fuzzing is a practical technique to automatically find vulnerabilities in software. It is well-suited to running at scale with distributed computing platforms thanks to its parallelizability. Therefore, individual researchers and companies typically setup fuzzing platforms on multiple servers and run fuzzers in parallel. However, as such resources are private, they suffer from financial and physical limits. In this paper, we propose Fuzzing@Home; the first public collaborative fuzzing network, based on heterogeneous machines owned by potentially untrusted users. Using our system, multiple organizations (or individuals) can easily collaborate to fuzz a software of common interest in an efficient way. One can participate and earn economic benefits if the fuzzing network is tied to a bug-bounty program, or simply donate spare computing power as a volunteer. If the network compensates collaborators, system fairness becomes an issue. In this light, we devise a system to make the fuzzing results verifiable and devise cheat detection techniques to ensure integrity and fairness in collaboration. In terms of performance, we devise a technique to effectively sync the global coverage state, hence minimizing the overhead for verifying computation results. Finally, to increase participation, Fuzzing@Home uses WebAssembly to run fuzzers inside the web browser engine, allowing anyone to instantly join a fuzzing network with a single click on their mobile phone, tablet, or any modern computing device. To evaluate our system, we bootstrapped Fuzzing@Home with 72 open-source projects and ran experimental fuzzing networks for 330 days with 826 collaborators as beta testers.},

However, extending the same to remote collaboration is limited by cumbersome setups for aligning distinct physical environments and the lack of access to remote physical artifacts. We present SurfShare, a general-purpose symmetric remote collaboration system with mixed-reality head-mounted displays (HMDs). Our system shares a spatially consistent physical-virtual workspace between two remote users, anchored on a physical plane in each environment (e.g., a desk or wall). The video feed of each user's physical surface is overlaid virtually on the other side, creating a shared view of the physical space. We integrate the physical and virtual workspace through virtual replication. Users can transmute physical objects to the virtual space as virtual replicas. Our system is lightweight, implemented using only the capabilities of the headset, without requiring any modifications to the environment (e.g. cameras or motion tracking hardware). We discuss the design, implementation, and interaction capabilities of our prototype, and demonstrate the utility of SurfShare through four example applications. In a user experiment with a comprehensive prototyping task, we found that SurfShare provides a physical-virtual workspace that supports low-fi prototyping with flexible proxemics and fluid collaboration dynamics.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has been a promising paradigm in distributed machine learning that enables in-situ model training and global model aggregation. While it can well preserve private data for end users, to apply it efficiently on IoT devices yet suffer from their inherent variants: their available computing resources are typically constrained, heterogeneous, and changing dynamically. Existing works deploy FL on IoT devices by pruning a sparse model or adopting a tiny counterpart, which alleviates the workload but may have negative impacts on model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose Eco-FL, a novel Edge Collaborative pipeline based Federated Learning framework. On the client side, each IoT device collaborates with trusted available devices in proximity to perform pipeline training, enabling local training acceleration with efficient augmented resource orchestration. On the server side, Eco-FL adopts a novel grouping-based hierarchical architecture that combines synchronous intra-group aggregation and asynchronous inter-group aggregation, where a heterogeneity-aware dynamic grouping strategy that jointly considers response latency and data distribution is developed. To tackle the resource fluctuation during the runtime, Eco-FL further applies an adaptive scheduling policy to judiciously adjust workload allocation and client grouping at different levels. Extensive experimental results using both prototype and simulation show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, Eco-FL can upgrade the training accuracy by up to 26.3%, reduce the local training time by up to 61.5%, and improve the local training throughput by up to 2.6 \texttimes{}.},

abstract = {Context: Producing new knowledge and innovative solutions are challenges for organizations and their Information Systems (IS). They are closely related to collaboration among professionals beyond the scope of specific individual skills and knowledge. Problem: Collaboration between people with heterogeneous professional experiences is widely discussed in the literature in different areas of knowledge but with little emphasis on collaboration in Information Systems (IS) teams. Additionally, there is no clear understanding of individual work experiences impact on the performance of IS teams. Solution: This study aims to understand the impact and influence of individual professional experience in the context of IS team collaboration through a systematic mapping study. IS Theory:The research was developed under the aegis of the Social Exchange Theory, particularly concerning the exchange of non-material goods. Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted. Results Summary: In general, studies indicate that professional experience impacts collaboration among professionals, resulting in better team performance, considering both quality and innovation of solutions. They also point out the influence of professional experience on learning process speed, using knowledge and skills to make cooperation more efficient. Besides that, professional experiences heterogeneity in IS teams brings a set of benefits and challenges to collaboration. Contributions and Impact in IS area: Identifying impacts, influences, benefits, and challenges on the topic assists in formulating theories that support the use of individual professional experience to improve collaboration results in IS teams based on the Social Exchange Theory. This study contributes to the Grand Research Challenge “Systemic and Socially Aware Perspective for Information Systems.”},

abstract = {The Equator interdisciplinary research collaboration has been exploring the combination of media such as mobile devices and collaborative virtual environments. We have built collaborative systems for a number of application areas including cultural heritage and tourism, performance, games, medical monitoring and environmental science. These systems have generally involved online visitors to a building or the city streets interacting with on-site visitors to the building or the streets. Sometimes the people online, using new media, are also on-site, using old media. Overall, Equator explores the interconnection and interweaving of activity in heterogeneous media which are usually treated in an isolated way. A number of higher-level design concepts have either motivated this work, or have arisen from experimentation with and evaluation of such systems. In this talk I offer my perspective on Equator's approach to ubicomp and HCI, giving examples of system designs, user experiences and conceptual work, and how they too are interconnected and interwoven in our research.},

abstract = {Services that collaborate alongside other services or systems for performing tasks, need to be aware of either predetermined or other abrupt and unexpected behaviors in other to adapt theirs. The service behaviors we consider are performed in smart city domains which are dynamic environments where continuously new services appear, that usually have a large variation in the way they perform the same task. We use roles having teamwork behavior to represent the composition procedure in such domains, and we model the team of services through the individual behavior of each participant as well as their group goal. In this paper, we present a framework, which consists of the approach and IT system in order to serve the choreography between a large number of heterogeneous services so as to achieve a seamless and cooperative environment suitable for a smart city. This enables composite city services to adapt their behavior during execution and themselves intervene from inside the team if a possible unexpected behavior happens during the service activity, in order to run proactively and avoid obstacles or collisions. A scenario from a smart city domain illustrates that, services having different teamwork abilities are composed to a new one which inherits teamwork features and combines them to something novel.},

abstract = {Version control systems are the foundation of collaborative workflows for text documents. For 3D environments though, version control is still an open problem due to the heterogeneous data of 3D scenes and their size. In this paper, we present a practical version control system for 3D scenes comprised of shapes, materials, textures, and animations, combined together in scene graphs. We version objects at their finest granularity, to make repositories smaller and to allow artists to work concurrently on the same object. Since, for some scene data, computing an optimal set of changes between versions is not computationally feasible, version control systems use heuristics. Compared to prior work, we propose heuristics that are efficient, robust, and independent of the application. We test our system on a variety of large scenes edited with different workflows, and show that our approach can handle all cases well while remaining efficient as scene size increases. Compared to prior work, we are significantly faster and more robust. A user study confirms that our system aids collaboration.},

abstract = {Data streams are increasingly needed for different types of applications and domains, where dynamicity and data velocity are of foremost importance. In this context, research challenges raise regarding the generation, publication, processing, and discovery of these streams, especially in distributed, heterogeneous and collaborative environments such as the Web. Stream reasoning has addressed some of these challenges in the last decade, presenting a novel data processing paradigm that lays at the intersection among semantic data modeling, stream processing, and inference techniques. However, stream reasoning works have focused almost exclusively on architectures and approaches that assume an isolated processing environment. Therefore, they lack, in general, the means for discovering, collaborating, negotiating, sharing, or validating data streams on a highly heterogeneous ecosystem as the Web. Agents and multi-agent systems research has long developed principles and foundations for enabling some of these features, although usually under assumptions that require to be revised in order to comply with the characteristics of data streams. This paper presents a vision for a Web of stream reasoning agents, capable of sharing not only streaming data, but also processing duties, using collaboration and negotiation protocols, while relying on common vocabularies and protocols that take into account the high dynamicity of their knowledge, goals, and behavioral patterns.},

abstract = {A great deal of research into Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) has assumed that search team members have the same level of unrestricted access to information. However, case studies and observations from different domains including government, healthcare and legal, have suggested that CIR sometimes involves people with unequal access to information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level CIR (MLCIR). In addition to supporting collaboration, MLCIR systems must ensure that there is no unintended disclosure of sensitive information, this is an under investigated area of research. In this paper we present results of an evaluation of an interface we have designed for MLCIR scenarios. Pairs of participants used the interface under 3 different information access scenarios for a variety of search tasks. These scenarios included 1 CIR and 2 MLCIR scenarios, namely: full access (FA), document removal (DR) and term blacklisting (TR). Design interviews were conducted post evaluation to obtain qualitative feedback from participants. Evaluation results showed that our interface performed well for both DR and FA scenarios but for TR, team members with less access had a negative influence on their partner's search performance, demonstrating insights into how different MLCIR scenarios should be supported. Design interview results showed that our interface helped the participants to reformulate their queries, understand their partner's performance, reduce duplicated work and review their team's search history without disclosing sensitive information.},

abstract = {Collaborative systems such as Grids provide efficient and scalable access to distributed computing capabilities and enable seamless resource sharing between users and platforms. This heterogeneous distribution of resources and the various modes of collaborations that exist between users, virtual organizations, and resource providers require scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control to protect both individual and shared computing resources. In this article we propose a usage control (UCON) based security framework for collaborative applications, by following a layered approach with policy, enforcement, and implementation models, called the PEI framework. In the policy model layer, UCON policies are specified with predicates on subject and object attributes, along with system attributes as conditional constraints and user actions as obligations. General attributes include not only persistent attributes such as role and group memberships but also mutable usage attributes of subjects and objects. Conditions in UCON can be used to support context-based authorizations in ad hoc collaborations. In the enforcement model layer, our novel framework uses a hybrid approach for subject attribute acquisition with both push and pull modes. By leveraging attribute propagations between a centralized attribute repository and distributed policy decision points, our architecture supports decision continuity and attribute mutability of the UCON policy model, as well as obligation evaluations during policy enforcement. As a proof-of-concept, we implement a prototype system based on our proposed architecture and conduct experimental studies to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach.},

Open data shares many characteristics with open-source software, as it can be used, modified, and redistributed by anyone, for free. However, in contrast to open-source software engineering, collaborative data engineering on open data lacks a shared understanding of processes, methods, and tools. This article presents a systematic literature review of collaboration processes, methods, and tools in data engineering as performed by open data users. An additional interview study with practitioners confirms and enhances the findings and strengthens the resulting insights. We find an ecosystem with heterogeneous participants and no standardized processes, methods, and tools. Participants face a variety of technical and social challenges during their work. Our work provides a structured overview of collaboration systems in open collaborative data engineering, enabling further research. Additionally, we contribute preliminary guidelines for successful open collaborative data engineering projects and recommendations to increase its adoption for open data ecosystems.},

To achieve optimal collaborative learning it is important to have a well designed script (preparation phase). It is also very important to being able to regulate learners' activities, because some activities can not be predicted in complex pedagogical scenarios as collaborative learning (regulation phase). WikiPlus helps enhancing the collaboration process by enabling the teacher to adapt the script whenever non predicted learner's activities happen. A prototype has been implemented, the impact of different regulation mechanisms on collaboration is discussed and wishes for macro script authoring tools of the future are formulated.},

abstract = {In various control systems, automation is implemented to increase efficiency and safety. With increased automation, it becomes increasingly relevant to view the automation as a team member, rather than as a tool. In best cases, human-automation teamwork keeps workload within acceptable limits, increase situation awareness, and keeps the operator in the control loop. However, human-automation teamwork will only flourish if the automation is developed with the human operator in mind. Therefore, investigations of the current experiences and expectations regarding automation and teamwork are important for the development of automation. Through a questionnaire among Air Traffic Controllers (ATCOs), the present study aims to investigate how ATCOs perceive automation and safety in current and future air traffic control systems and the importance of different teamwork factors for human-human and human-automation collaboration. The results indicate that the ATCOs believe that safety will increase in the future along with increasing automation as long as the automation is working as expected. The ATCOs expressed a fear of deskilling and losing situation awareness with automation, a fear associated with a new ATCO role of monitoring the system and take over when the automation fails. The results suggest that design for human-automation teamwork aspects that ATCOs value, such as adaptability or mutual performance monitoring, could be a way forward.},

abstract = {With the widespread use of cloud-native architecture, increasing web applications (apps) choose to build on microservices. Simultaneously, troubleshooting becomes full of challenges owing to the high dynamics and complexity of anomaly propagation. Existing diagnostic methods rely heavily on monitoring metrics collected from the kernel side of microservice systems. Without a comprehensive monitoring infrastructure, application owners and even cloud operators cannot resort to these kernel-space solutions. This paper summarizes several insights on operating a top commercial cloud platform. Then, for the first time, we put forward the idea of user-space diagnosis for microservice kernel failures. To this end, we develop a crowdsourcing solution - DyCause, to resolve the asymmetric diagnostic information problem. DyCause deploys on the application side in a distributed manner. Through lightweight API log sharing, apps collect the operational status of kernel services collaboratively and initiate diagnosis on demand. Deploying DyCause is fast and lightweight as we do not have any architectural and functional requirements for the kernel. To reveal more accurate correlations from asymmetric diagnostic information, we design a novel statistical algorithm that can efficiently discover the time-varying causalities between services. This algorithm also helps us build the temporal order of the anomaly propagation. Therefore, by using DyCause, we can obtain more in-depth and interpretable diagnostic clues with limited indicators. We apply and evaluate DyCause on both a simulated test-bed and a real-world cloud system. Experimental results verify that DyCause running in the user-space outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms running in the kernel on accuracy. Besides, DyCause shows superior advantages in terms of algorithmic efficiency and data sensitivity. Simply put, DyCause produces a significantly better result than other baselines when analyzing much fewer or sparser metrics. To conclude, DyCause is faster to act, deeper in analysis, and easier to deploy.},

Accessing externalities such as files, databases, network connections, environment variables, and the system clock is not as straightforward in replicated collaborative software as in single-user applications or centralized collaborative systems. We describe ad hoc solutions that add to development cost and complexity because the developer must program different behavior for different replicas.We introduce a novel general approach to accessing externalities uniformly in a replicated collaborative system. The approach uses a semireplicated architecture where the actual externality resides at a single location and is accessed via replicated proxies. This approach allows developers of replicated synchronous groupware to 1) use similar externality access mechanisms as in traditional single-user applications, and 2) program all replicas to execute the same behavior. We describe a general design for proxied access to read-only, write-only, and read-write externalities and discuss the tradeoffs of this semireplicated approach over full, literal replication and the class of applications to which this approach can be successfully applied. We also describe details of a prototype implementation of this approach within a replicated collaboration-transparency system, called Flexible JAMM (Java Applets Made Multiuser).},

abstract = {This talk will discuss progress in building collaborative multimodal systems, both systems that offer a collaborative interface that augments human performance, and autonomous systems with which one can collaborate. To begin, I discuss what we will mean by collaboration, which revolves around plan recognition skills learned as a child. Then, I present a collaborative multimodal operations planning system, Sketch-Thru-Plan, that enables users to interact multimodally with speech and pen as it attempts to infer their plans. The system offers suggested actions and allows the user to confirm/disconfirm those suggestions. I show how the collaborative multimodal interface enables more rapid task performance and higher user satisfaction than existing deployed GUIs built for the same task.  In the second part of the talk, I discuss the differences for system design between building such a collaborative multimodal interface and building an autonomous agent with which one can collaborate through multimodal dialogue. I argue that interacting with an autonomous agent (e.g., a robot or virtual assistant) may require a more declarative approach to supporting collaborative communication. People’s deeply engrained collaboration strategies will be seen to be at the foundation of dialogue and are expected by human interlocutors. The approach I will advocate to implementing such a strategy is to build a belief-desire-intention (BDI) architecture that attempts to recognize the collaborator’s plans, and determine obstacles to their success. The system then plans and executes a response to overcome those obstacles, which results in the system’s planning appropriate actions (including speech acts). I will illustrate and demonstrate a system that embodies this type of collaboration, engaging users in dialogue about travel planning. Finally, I will compare this approach with current academic and research approaches to dialogue.},

abstract = {In ubiquitous environments smart devices collaborate although they were never designed specifically for each other. A smart tv acts as a display for a smart phone on demand without installing specific software. However, the variety of collaborations among smart devices is limited. Given a smart home environment, a smart door bell equipped with a camera should easily integrate and utilize its newly provided functionality in collaboration with existing devices like using a smart tv as display. Further it should be able to adapt to environmental changes, e.g., when the user changes the room another device should take over the displaying part. Composing distributed adaptive software systems at run time is a challenging topic in decentralized infrastructures like Smart Cities or Internets of Things. Such infrastructures consist of a large set of independent autonomous subsystems from different providers, but only a few subsystems might be involved in a composition. Centralized self-adaptive approaches maintain a global view on the system which is infeasible for large infrastructures. Decentralized approaches are limited in terms of heterogeneity and lack incorporation of new functionality.},

abstract = {Handheld Augmented Reality (AR) displays offer a see-through option to create the illusion of virtual objects being integrated into the viewer's physical environment. Some AR display technologies also allow for the deactivation of the see-through option, turning AR tablets into Virtual Reality (VR) devices that integrate the virtual objects into an exclusively virtual environment. Both display configurations are typically available on handheld devices, raising the question of their influence on users' experience during collaborative activities. In two experiments, we studied how the different display configurations influence user experience, workload, and team performance of co-located and distributed collaborators during a spatial referencing task. A mixed-methods approach revealed that participants' opinions were polarized towards the two display configurations, regardless of the spatial distribution of collaboration. Based on our findings, we identify critical aspects to be addressed in future research to better understand and support co-located and distributed collaboration using AR and VR displays.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous CPU-FPGA systems are evolving towards tighter integration between CPUs and FPGAs for improved performance and energy efficiency. At the same time, programmability is also improving with High Level Synthesis tools (e.g., OpenCL Software Development Kits), which allow programmers to express their designs with high-level programming languages, and avoid time-consuming and error-prone register-transfer level (RTL) programming. In the traditional loosely-coupled accelerator mode, FPGAs work as offload accelerators, where an entire kernel runs on the FPGA while the CPU thread waits for the result. However, tighter integration of the CPUs and the FPGAs enables the possibility of fine-grained collaborative execution, i.e., having both devices working concurrently on the same workload. Such collaborative execution makes better use of the overall system resources by employing both CPU threads and FPGA concurrency, thereby achieving higher performance. In this paper, we explore the potential of collaborative execution between CPUs and FPGAs using OpenCL High Level Synthesis. First, we compare various collaborative techniques (namely, data partitioning and task partitioning), and evaluate the tradeoffs between them. We observe that choosing the most suitable partitioning strategy can improve performance by up to 2x. Second, we study the impact of a common optimization technique, kernel duplication, in a collaborative CPU-FPGA context. We show that the general trend is that kernel duplication improves performance until the memory bandwidth saturates. Third, we provide new insights that application developers can use when designing CPU-FPGA collaborative applications to choose between different partitioning strategies. We find that different partitioning strategies pose different tradeoffs (e.g., task partitioning enables more kernel duplication, while data partitioning has lower communication overhead and better load balance), but they generally outperform execution on conventional CPU-FPGA systems where no collaborative execution strategies are used. Therefore, we advocate even more integration in future heterogeneous CPU-FPGA systems (e.g., OpenCL 2.0 features, such as fine-grained shared virtual memory).},

abstract = {The correct and timely creation of systems for coordination of group work depends on the ability to express, analyze, and experiment with protocols for managing multiple work threads. We present an evolution of the Trellis model that provides a formal basis for prototyping the coordination structure of a collaboration system. In Trellis, group interaction protocols are represented separately from the interface processes that use them for coordination. Protocols are interpreted (rather than compiled into applications) so group interactions can be changed as a collaborative task progresses. Changes can be made either by a person editing the protocol specification “on the fly” or by a silent “observation” process that participates in an application solely to  perform behavioral adaptations.Trellis uniquely mixes hypermedia browsing with collaboration support. We term this combination a hyperprogram, and we say that a hyperprogram integrates the description of a collaborative task with the information required for that task. As illustration, we describe a protocol for a moderated meeting and show a Trellis prototype conference tool controlled by this protocol.},

abstract = {Collaborative systems are well established solutions for sharing work among people. In computer graphics these workflows are still not well established, compared to what is done for text writing or software development. Usually artists work alone and share their final models by sending files. In this paper we present a system for collaborative 3D digital sculpting. In our prototype, multiple artists concurrently sculpt a polygonal mesh on their local machines by changing its vertex properties, such as positions and material BRDFs. Our system shares the artists' edits automatically and seamlessly merges these edits even when they happen on the same region of the surface. We propose a merge algorithm that is fast-enough for seamless collaboration, respects users' edits as much as possible, can support any sculpting operation, and works for both geometry and appearance modifications. Since in sculpting artists alternatively perform fine adjustments and large scale modifications, our algorithm is based on a multiresolution edit representation that handles concurrent overlapping edits at different scales. We tested our algorithm by modeling meshes collaboratively in different sculpting sessions and found that our algorithm outperforms prior works on collaborative mesh editing in all cases.},

Although studies show that synchronous collaboration can bring multiple benefits, such as enhanced productivity and writing quality, little is known about these writing practices in classrooms and their impact on students' writing. Using a mixed method approach, we conducted an empirical study that explores the different styles of synchronous collaboration in 45 Google Docs documents produced by 82 undergraduate students, and how students' practices affect the specific dimensions of the final text including quality. The results suggest that (a) out of four styles, Divide and Conquer style tended to produce better quality text whereas Main Writer had the lowest quality scores, and that (b) balanced participation and amount of peer editing led to longer texts with higher quality scores for content, evidence, but not organization or mechanics. Given these results, we suggest several design features for collaborative writing systems and propose guidelines for instructional practices.},

abstract = {Following the tradition of these acceptance talks, I will be giving my thoughts on where our field is going. Any discussion of the future of information retrieval (IR) research, however, needs to be placed in the context of its history and relationship to other fields. Although IR has had a very strong relationship with library and information science, its relationship to computer science (CS) and its relative standing as a sub-discipline of CS has been more dynamic. IR is quite an old field, and when a number of CS departments were forming in the 60s, it was not uncommon for a faculty member to be pursuing research related to IR. Early ACM curriculum recommendations for CS contained courses on information retrieval, and encyclopedias described IR and database systems as different aspects of the same field.By the 70s, there were only a few IR researchers in CS departments in the U.S., database systems was a separate (and thriving) field, and many felt that IR had stagnated and was largely irrelevant. The truth, in fact, was far from that. The IR research community was a small, but dedicated, group of researchers in the U.S. and Europe who were motivated by a desire to understand the process of information retrieval and to build systems that would help people find the right information in text databases. This was (and is) a hard goal and led to different evaluation metrics and methodologies than the database community. Progress in the field was hampered by a lack of large-scale testbeds and tests were limited to databases containing at most a few hundred document abstracts.In the 80s AI boom, IR was still not a mainstream area, despite its focus on a human task involving natural language. IR focused on a statistical approach to language rather than the much more popular knowledge-based approach. The fact that IR conferences mix papers on effectiveness as measured by human judgments with papers measuring performance of file organizations for large-scale systems has meant that IR has always been difficult to classify into simple categories such as "systems" or "AI" that are often used in CS departments.Since the early 90s, just about everything has changed. Large, full-text databases were finally made available for experimentation through DARPA funding and TREC. This has had an enormous positive impact on the quantity and quality of IR research. The advent of the Web search engine has validated the longstanding claims made by IR researchers that simple queries and ranking were the right techniques for information access in a largely unstructured information world. What has not changed is that there are still relatively few IR researchers in CS departments. There are, however, many more people in CS departments doing IR-related research, which is just about the same thing. Conferences in databases, machine learning, computational linguistics, and data mining publish a number of IR papers done by people who would not primarily consider themselves as IR researchers.Given that there is an increasing diffusion of IR ideas into the CS community, it is worth stating what IR, as a field of CS, has accomplished:    Search engines have become the infrastructure for much of information access in our society. IR has provided the basic research on the algorithms and data structures for these engines, and continues to develop new capabilities such as cross-lingual search, distributed search, question answering, and topic detection and tracking.IR championed the statistical approach to language long before it was accepted by other researchers working on language technologies. Statistical NLP is now mainstream and results from that field are being used to improve IR systems (in question answering, for example).IR focused on evaluation as a research area, and developed an evaluation methodology based on large, standardized testbeds and comparison with human judgments that has been adopted by researchers in a number of other language technology areas.IR, because of its focus on measuring success based on human judgments, has always acknowledged the importance of the user and interaction as a part of information access. This led to a number of contributions to the design of query and search interfaces and learning techniques based on user feedback.  Although these achievements are important, the long-term goals of the IR field have not yet been met. What are those goals? One possibility that is often mentioned is the MEMEX of Vannevar Bush [1]. Another, more recent, statement of long-term challenges was made in the report of the IR Challenges Workshop [2]:    Global Information Access: Satisfy human information needs through natural, efficient interaction with an automated system that leverages world-wide structured and unstructured data in any language.Contextual Retrieval; Combine search technologies and knowledge about query and user context into a single framework in order to provide the most appropriate answer for a user's information need. These goals are, in fact, very similar to long-term challenges coming out of other CS fields. For example, Jim Gray, a Turing Award winner from the database area, mentioned in his address a personal and world MEMEX as long-term goals for his field and CS in general [3]. IR's long-term goals are clearly important long-term goals for the whole of CS, and achieving those goals will involve everyone interested in the general area of information management and retrieval. Rather than talking about what IR can do in isolation to progress towards its goals, I would prefer to talk about what IR can do in collaboration with other areas.There are many examples of potential collaborative research areas. Collaborations with researchers from the NLP and information extraction communities have been developing for some time in order to study topics such as advanced question answering. On the other hand, not enough has been done to work with the database community to develop probabilistic retrieval models for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data. There have been a number of attempts to combine IR and database functionality, none of which has been particularly successful. Most recently, some groups have been working on combining IR search with XML documents, but what is needed is a comprehensive examination of the issues and problems by teams from both areas working together, and the creation of new testbeds that can be used to evaluate proposed models. The time is right for such collaborations.Another example of where database, IR, and networking people can work together is in the development of distributed, heterogeneous information systems. This requires significant new research in areas like peer-to-peer architectures, semantic heterogeneity, automatic metadata generation, and retrieval models.If the information systems described above are extended to include new data types such as video, images, sound, and the whole range of scientific data (such as from the biosciences, geoscience, and astronomy), then a broad range of new challenges are added that need to be tackled in collaboration with people who know about these types of data.There should also be more cooperation between the data mining, IR, and summarization communities to tackle the core problem of defining what is new and interesting in streams of data.These and other similar collaborations will the basis for the future development of the IR field. We will continue to work on research problems that specifically interest us, but this research will increasingly be in the context of larger efforts. IR concepts and IR research will be an important part of the evolving mix of CS expertise that will be used to solve the "grand" challenges.},

abstract = {The engineering and maintenance of large (software) systems is an inherently collaborative process that involves diverse engineering teams, heterogeneous development artifacts, and different engineering tools. While teams have to collaborate continuously and their artifacts are often related, the tools they use are nearly always independent, single-user applications. These tools range from programming to modeling tools and cover a wide range of engineering disciplines. However, relations among the artifacts across these tools often remain undocumented and are handled in an adhoc manner. Keeping these artifacts in sync continues to be a key engineering challenge. In this paper, we present our vision of the DesignSpace, a novel engineering infrastructure for integrating diverse development artifacts and their relations. The DesignSpace supports distributed collaboration, a wide range of tools and development, maintenance, and evolution services including incremental consistency checking and transformation.},

This is further supported by the mental effort and perceived dominance reported by users. Feedback from users also indicated visual communication cues are valuable for remote users in MP systems.},

At the other extreme, shared workspaces provide formal, structured collaboration, but are too heavyweight for users to set up. To bridge this gap between the ad hoc and formal, this paper introduces the notion of "object-centric sharing", where users collaborate in a lightweight manner but aggregate and organize different types of shared artifacts into semi-structured activities with dynamic membership, hierarchical object relationships, as well as real-time and asynchronous collaboration. We present a working prototype implemented with a replicated peer-to-peer architecture, which we describe in detail, and demonstrate its performance in synchronous and asynchronous modes.},

abstract = {In recent years, especially after the outbreak of COVID-19, the applications of distributed collaboration in mixed reality (MR) environment has developed rapidly. Due to the cutting-edge technology and the specialized nature of the equipment, many studies have focused on the design of tutorials in MR, but few studies have taken the factors of emotional design into consideration. Since the perception of the state among users is based on their avatar firstly, which is helpful for users' perceptions about collaborative content in novice guidance. Based on Norman's principles of reflective design and James' theory about the experience self, we built a MR virtual sand-table collaboration system, which contains three guiding parts that are the full practice of theoretical research. Furthermore, We generated three progressive levels of emotional solutions in guidance design and conducted user experience research to explore the impact of three different degrees of emotional design, summarizing the applicable paradigm of novice guidance of emotional design in MR distributed collaborative scenarios. Through the evaluation and analysis of SUS model and task load, we found that novice guidance with a higher emotional design level, which combines static graphics, dynamic hand models and conversational voice would result in a better user experience.},

abstract = {We describe a new collaborative technology that is mid-way between the informality of email and the formality of shared workspaces. Email and other ad hoc collaboration systems are typically lightweight and flexible, but build up an unmanageable clutter of copied objects. At the other extreme, shared workspaces provide formal, structured collaboration, but are too heavyweight for users to set up. To bridge this gap between the ad hoc and formal, this paper introduces the notion of "object-centric sharing", where users collaborate in a lightweight manner but aggregate and organize different types of shared artifacts into semi-structured activities with dynamic membership, hierarchical object relationships, as well as real-time and asynchronous collaboration. We present a working prototype implemented with a replicated peer-to-peer architecture, which we describe in detail, and demonstrate its performance in synchronous and asynchronous modes.},

abstract = {Real-world deployment of federated learning requires orchestrating clients with widely varied compute resources, from strong enterprise-grade devices in data centers to weak mobile and Web-of-Things devices. Prior works have attempted to downscale large models for weak devices and aggregate shared parts among heterogeneous models. A typical architectural assumption is that there are equally many strong and weak devices. In reality, however, we often encounter resource skew where a few (1 or 2) strong devices hold substantial data resources, alongside many weak devices. This poses challenges-the unshared portion of the large model rarely receives updates or gains benefits from weak collaborators.We aim to facilitate reciprocal benefits between strong and weak devices in resource-skewed environments. We propose RecipFL, a novel framework featuring a server-side graph hypernetwork. This hypernetwork is trained to produce parameters for personalized client models adapted to device capacity and unique data distribution. It effectively generalizes knowledge about parameters across different model architectures by encoding computational graphs. Notably, RecipFL is agnostic to model scaling strategies and supports collaboration among arbitrary neural networks. We establish the generalization bound of RecipFL through theoretical analysis and conduct extensive experiments with various model architectures. Results show that RecipFL improves accuracy by 4.5% and 7.4% for strong and weak devices respectively, incentivizing both devices to actively engage in federated learning.},

abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays digital information with real-world scenes surrounding a user, provides an enhanced mode of interaction with the ambient world. Contextual AR applications rely on image recognition to identify objects in the view of the mobile device. In practice, due to image distortions and device resource constraints, achieving high performance image recognition for AR is challenging. Recent advances in edge computing offer opportunities for designing collaborative image recognition frameworks for AR. In this demonstration, we present CollabAR, an edge-assisted collaborative image recognition framework. CollabAR allows AR devices that are facing the same scene to collaborate on the recognition task. Demo participants develop an intuition for different image distortions and their impact on image recognition accuracy. We showcase how heterogeneous images taken by different users can be aggregated to improve recognition accuracy and provide a better user experience in AR.},

One important quality of a tele-collaboration system is the sense of co-presence as felt by the participating users. Virtual and augmented reality based implementations and media presentation will have different ramification toward the sense of co-presence and effectiveness of the communication. In this paper, we propose to carry out a preliminary study comparing various mixed reality based 3D collaborative media in two dimensions: (1) the form of the background (real vs. virtual) and (2) the form of user (photo-realistically reconstructed vs. pre-built 3D avatar). The traditional video based system is also compared as a reference for which both the background and user is represented in real but in 2D flat screen. We present the experimental design and report the results.},

abstract = {This article describes Distributed W-Learning (DWL), a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for collaborative agent-based optimization of pervasive systems. DWL supports optimization towards multiple heterogeneous policies and addresses the challenges arising from the heterogeneity of the agents that are charged with implementing them. DWL learns and exploits the dependencies between agents and between policies to improve overall system performance. Instead of always executing the locally-best action, agents learn how their actions affect their immediate neighbors and execute actions suggested by neighboring agents if their importance exceeds the local action's importance when scaled using a predefined or learned collaboration coefficient. We have evaluated DWL in a simulation of an Urban Traffic Control (UTC) system, a canonical example of the large-scale pervasive systems that we are addressing. We show that DWL outperforms widely deployed fixed-time and simple adaptive UTC controllers under a variety of traffic loads and patterns. Our results also confirm that enabling collaboration between agents is beneficial as is the ability for agents to learn the degree to which it is appropriate for them to collaborate. These results suggest that DWL is a suitable basis for optimization in other large-scale systems with similar characteristics.},

abstract = {Emergency rescue scenarios are considered to be high-risk scenarios. Using a micro air vehicle (MAV) swarm to explore the environment can provide valuable environmental information. However, due to the absence of localization infrastructure and the limited on-board capabilities, it's challenging for the low-cost MAV swarm to maintain precise localization. In this paper, a collaborative localization system for the low-cost heterogeneous MAV swarm is proposed. This system takes full advantage of advanced MAV to effectively achieve accurate localization of the heterogeneous MAV swarm through collaboration. Subsequently, H-SwarmLoc, a reinforcement learning-based planning method is proposed to plan the advanced MAV with a non-myopic objective in real-time. The experimental results show that the localization performance of our method improves 40% on average compared with baselines.},

abstract = {Smart Grids interconnect stakeholders and technologies in the energy domain for the sake of enabling new ways of interacting within the energy system through the usage of information and communication technologies. However, the facilitation of new business models and competition in the energy domain is not purely a technological issue. Besides technological complexity, stakeholders with different knowledge, expertise, and methods are necessary for Smart Grid developments. This heterogeneity also results in specific social challenges. The industry-standard IEC 62559-2 leverages Use Cases for modelling the so-called Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) to assess the technical interoperability and complexity of future energy systems. With its focus on ICT standardization and its implementation, it only implicitly considers involved stakeholders. However, social interaction and the underlying dynamics of power and knowledge exchange critically influence the development process. Therefore, we propose a social perspective in these collaborative development processes of SGAM with a focus on the stakeholders. For the modelling of social collaboration within the SGAM, we expand the proximity concept by Boschma (2005) to show the characteristics and the relations of stakeholders involved. Our research presents an additional 'Social Layer' for the SGAM to show the prevailing heterogeneity of the stakeholders and illustrates this with an empirical case study. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of stakeholder collaboration and its characteristics in the Smart Grid development processes.},

abstract = {The realms of commonsense knowledge and reasoning, vehicle automation with full as well as partial autonomy, and human-robot collaboration, present growing areas of research in recent times, with much of the concerned data being disseminated through the Web and devices encompassing IoT (Internet of Things); the data per se being heterogeneous including plain text, images, audiovisuals, hypertext and hypermedia. Due to the advent of autonomous vehicles, there is a greater need for the embodiment of commonsense knowledge within their development in order to simulate subtle, intuitive aspects of human judgment. The field of robotics has often encountered collaborative tasks between humans and robots to enhance the respective activities involved and produce better results than humans or robots would achieve working by themselves. Accordingly, this article outlines and organizes some of the research occurring in these areas along with its Web perspectives and applications. Context related to human-robot collaboration and commonsense knowledge appears via a survey of the literature. Vehicle automation is significant with the relevant studies: its definition and methods of improvement are of focus in the article. Some work in this area makes an impact on smart manufacturing. There is discussion on how human-robot collaboration is beneficial, and how commonsense knowledge is useful for the collaboration to occur in an enhanced manner. This article would be potentially interesting to various communities, e.g. AI professionals, Web developers, robotics engineers, and data scientists.},

This approach is inspired by theories of creativity as being more problem-framing than problem-solving, and contrasts with the automated one-shot end-to-end workflows of most generative AI models. A 12-participant qualitative exploratory study of the capabilities of our prototype is detailed, as well as a thematic analysis of user attitudes towards drawing with it. The paper then describes two modified prototypes and a second 32-participant comparative study revealing how interface variations evoke differences in user attitudes and experiences. It concludes by proposing a model that characterises the conditions under which users experience co-creative AI as a collaborator, rather than a non-agentive tool.},

It is co-sponsored by the INTEROP Network of Excellence and the SEEMseed project in order to connect researchers and to exchange ideas and results in the interoperability domain.Interacting and exchanging information with internal or external partners is a key issue. If companies want to survive in the current market situation, a tight collaboration is needed. A seamless collaboration is, however, only possible if all participating information systems are able to semantically exchange information. The system topographies in today's companies are characterized by a high heterogeneity linked with various data models and formats. Interoperability between systems is therefore a major challenge for enterprises because of the high heterogeneity.Today there are several approaches for creating a unified possibility of accessing heterogeneous information systems. Possible solutions are, for example, found in the domain of merging ontologies, linking or mapping different standards, or in the domain of model interoperability technologies like model morphing or transformation.Ambition of this workshop is to get an overview about current research activities as well as a broad discussion in certain areas of interoperability of heterogeneous information systems. It is proposed to connect research experts from these domains and to exchange ideas and approaches.The IHIS'05 workshop is not to be seen as a one-day-event but as a basis for regular exchange and cooperation of the community as it is the intention of the INTEROP NoE. We therefore intent to keep the participants informed about the results of the workshop and to make the results available for the public and we intend to foster the cooperation between experts during and after the workshop.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of dynamic protocol selection in open and heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) for collaborative task performance. Protocols are interaction patterns which help agents coordinate their activities. Usually, agent designers select the protocols to be used for collaborative task performance. In open and heterogeneous MAS, such selection may lead to protocol mismatch at run time. Protocol selection mismatch may in turn result in a collaborative task not being performed, although it could have been performed had the protocols been selected properly. Our solution to this problem is to enable agents to dynamically select protocols. We first study the characteristics of protocols and the descriptions of collaborative tasks. Using these characteristics and descriptions, we devise mechanisms that enable agents to dynamically select protocols when they have to perform a task in collaboration. In this work we relax some restrictive assumptions made in prior work on protocol selection, and which may hinder collaborative task performance. In particular, we do not assume that agents trust one another. Additionally, because there is no protocol specification standard, we allow several protocol specification formalisms to coexist. Our method allows agents to select their protocols locally and individually, yet coordinate their selection with other agents' selections based on message exchange flows. Since the selection is performed locally, some errors may occur in the process. Our mechanisms provide means for detecting such errors and overcoming them. As we show, the complexity of our solution is empirically sufficiently low for practical use, and the level of success in coordinated protocol selection is very high.},

abstract = {Cyber physical ecosystem connects different intelligent devices over heterogeneous networks. Various operations are performed on smart objects to ensure efficiency and to support automation in smart environments. An Activity (defined by Gupta and Sandhu) reflects the current state of an object, which changes in response to requested operations. Due to multiple running activities on different objects, it is critical to secure collaborative systems considering run-time decisions impacted due to related activities (and other parameters) supporting active enforcement of access control decision. Recently, Gupta and Sandhu proposed Activity-Centric Access Control (ACAC) and discussed the notion of activity as a prime abstraction for access control in collaborative systems. The model provides an active security approach that considers activity decision factors such as authorizations, obligations, conditions, and dependencies among related device activities. This paper takes a step forward and presents the core components of an ACAC model and compares with other security models differentiating novel properties of ACAC. We highlight how existing models do not (or in limited scope) support 'active' decision and enforcement of authorization in collaborative systems. We propose a hierarchical structure for a family of ACAC models by gradually adding the properties related to notion of activity and discuss states of an activity. We highlight the convergence of ACAC with Zero Trust tenets to reflect how ACAC supports necessary security posture of distributed and connected smart ecosystems. This paper aims to gain a better understanding of ACAC in collaborative systems supporting novel abstractions, properties and requirements.},

Effectively exploring such datasets requires collaboration between multiple analysts, who more often than not are distributed in time or in space. Mixed-presence groupware provide a shared workspace medium that supports this combination of co-located and distributed collaboration. However, collaborative visualization systems for such distributed settings have their own cost and are still uncommon in the visualization community. We present Hugin, a novel layer-based graphical framework for this kind of mixed-presence synchronous collaborative visualization over digital tabletop displays. The design of the framework focuses on issues like awareness and access control, while using information visualization for the collaborative data exploration on network-connected tabletops. To validate the usefulness of the framework, we also present examples of how Hugin can be used to implement new visualizations supporitng these collaborative mechanisms.},

abstract = {Wikis are well known systems to support collaborative assignments. They provide a digital platform for asynchronous collaboration between students under the monitoring of a supervisor. Additionally, as all the students' interactions are recorded in the wiki database, teachers can retrieve interesting data for skill assessment. On the one hand, there are different approaches for skill assessment based on quantitative data obtained from the wiki. Their main advantage is that they are based on objective data that can be automatically retrieved. Unfortunately, they are rather coarse-grained and different interesting aspects regarding the contributions to the wiki can be dismissed. On the other hand, qualitative approaches offer a more detailed assessment process, but their automation is limited. This can lead to scalability problems in large groups of students. Based on our previous experience using both methods, we propose a mixed approach integrating quantitative and qualitative data for assessment of wiki collaborative assignments. It is supported by the software system Clever Figures 4 MediaWiki, which has been specifically developed for this purpose. Its application shows promising results, generating ranking and charts than combine both sources of information.},

CCF constructs a virtual work environment on multiple computer systems connected over the Internet, to form a Collaboratory. In this setting, participants interact with each other, simultaneously access and operate computer applications, refer to global data repositories or archives, collectively create and manipulate documents or other artifacts, perform computational transformations, and conduct a number of other activities via telepresence. Research issues addressed in this project include problem solving environments and methodologies for laboratory and instrument-based scientific disciplines, and computer science issues in heterogeneous distributed systems. New approaches are being investigated and developed for fast multiway communication, robust geographically distributed data management methodologies, high-performance computational transforms inlined within collaboration sessions, and related auxiliary issues such as active documents, security, archival storage, and experiment management and control. In this paper, we discuss the design philosophy and systems rationale behind CCF, describe the major subsystems of the collaborative computing environment, and discuss the salient features of the system.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing environments are complex systems containing a great amount of heterogeneous devices and services available to users. Both user needs and services offered to them evolve very fast. This evolution requires the adaptation of the software architectures that support user activities. Moreover, such adaptation must be based on application semantics in order to better respond to user needs in any situation. This paper presents a work in progress that aims to build an architecture enabling the development of adaptive collaborative applications in ubiquitous computing environments. An ontology model, containing generic collaboration knowledge as well as domain-specific knowledge, is proposed in order to enable architecture adaptation and to support spontaneous and implicit sessions inside groups of humans and devices.},

We compared our hybrid system and its output with designs of real circuits to determine the difference through a system evaluation and observed minimal differences. We then present the results of an informal study with 9 users, where we gathered feedback on the effectiveness of our system in different working conditions (with a desktop, using a mobile, and with a remote collaborator). We conclude by sharing our lessons learned from our system and discuss directions for future research that blend physical and virtual prototyping for electronic circuits.},

abstract = {Developing a collaborative application running on a collection of heterogeneous, possibly mobile, devices, each potentially hosting data stores, using existing middleware technologies such as JXTA, BREW, compact .NET and J2ME requires too many ad-hoc techniques as well as cumbersome and time-consuming programming. Our System on Mobile Devices (SyD) middleware, on the other hand, has a modular architecture that makes such application development very systematic and streamlined. The architecture supports transactions over mobile data stores, with a range of remote group invocation options and embedded interdependencies among such data store objects. The architecture further provides a persistent uniform object view, group transaction with Quality of Service (QoS) specifications, and XML vocabulary for inter-device communication. This paper presents the basic SyD concepts and introduces the architecture and the design of the SyD middleware and its components. We also provide guidelines for SyD application development and deployment process. We include the basic performance figures of SyD components and a few SyD applications on Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) platforms. We believe that SyD is the first comprehensive working prototype of its kind, with a small code footprint of 112 KB with 76 KB being device-resident, and has a good potential for incorporating many ideas for performance extensions, scalability, QoS, workflows and security.},

isbn = {9781509049318},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The integrated architecture that features both CPU and GPU on the same die is an emerging and promising architecture for fine-grained CPU-GPU collaboration. However, the integration also brings forward several programming and system optimization challenges, especially for irregular applications. The complex interplay between heterogeneity and irregularity leads to very low processor utilization of running irregular applications on integrated architectures. Furthermore, fine-grained co-processing on the CPU and GPU is still an open problem. Particularly, in this paper, we show that the previous workload partitioning for CPU-GPU co-processing is far from ideal in terms of resource utilization and performance. To solve this problem, we propose a system software named FinePar, which considers architectural differences of the CPU and GPU and leverages fine-grained collaboration enabled by integrated architectures. Through irregularity-aware performance modeling and online auto-tuning, FinePar partitions irregular workloads and achieves both device-level and thread-level load balance. We evaluate FinePar with 8 irregular applications on an AMD integrated architecture and compare it with state-of-the-art partitioning approaches. Results show that FinePar demonstrates better resource utilization and achieves an average of 1.38X speedup over the optimal coarse-grained partitioning method.},

abstract = {In today's volatile business environments, collaboration between information systems, both within and across company borders, has become essential to success. An efficient supply chain, for example, requires the collaboration of distributed and heterogeneous systems of multiple companies. Developing such collaborative applications and building the supporting information systems poses several engineering challenges. A key challenge is to manage the ever-growing design complexity. In this article, we argue that software architecture should play a more prominent role in the development of collaborative applications. This can help to better manage design complexity by modularizing collaborations and separating concerns. State-of-the-art solutions, however, often lack proper abstractions for modeling collaborations at architectural level or do not reify these abstractions at detailed design and implementation level. Developers, on the other hand, rely on middleware, business process management, and Web services, techniques that mainly focus on low-level infrastructure.To address the problem of managing the design complexity of collaborative applications, we present Macodo. Macodo consists of three complementary parts: (1) a set of abstractions for modeling adaptive collaborations, (2) a set of architectural views, the main contribution of this article, that reify these abstractions at architectural level, and (3) a proof-of-concept middleware infrastructure that supports the architectural abstractions at design and implementation level. We evaluate the architectural views in a controlled experiment. Results show that the use of Macodo can reduce fault density and design complexity, and improve reuse and productivity. The main contributions of this article are illustrated in a supply chain management case.},

abstract = {Museums offer an ideal environment for informal cultural learning on heritage artifacts, where visitors get engaged in learning due to an intrinsic motivation. Sharing the museum space among visitors allows for collective learning experiences and socializing with each other. Museums aim to design and deploy Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) in order to embrace the physical materialities of artifacts in the visiting experience. TUIs are believed to be more collaborative, attract more visitors, and persuade them to explore further. Cultural learning on heritage artifacts is particularly meaningful from the early age when opinions and attitudes are shaped. Museums accordingly follow a gamification approach (i.e., using game elements in a non-game context) to provide a collaborative and entertaining learning experience to young visitors. In this study, we investigate the implications of merging these two approaches in order to take advantage of the qualities of both TUIs and gamification in an educational museum context.Accordingly, we present TouchTomb and its evaluation in a real-world museum environment. TouchTomb is a situated tangible gamification installation that aims to enhance informal cultural learning for young visitors and to foster engagement and collaboration among them. The basis of the installation is a shared progress bar and three games with different spatial configurations, embedded into a custom fabricated replica of an original ancient Egyptian tomb-chapel wall on a 1:1 scale. Our field study involved 14 school visits with a total number of 190 school pupils (from 10 to 14 years old). We deployed a mixed-method evaluation to investigate how such a tangible gamification approach entertains and educates 15 pupils collectively for a maximum of 15 minutes, including the evaluation procedures. We particularly investigated how the different spatial configurations of the game setups influenced the stages of pupils’ cultural learning, and the levels of engagement and collaboration among them. We conclude the article by discussing the qualities of tangible gamification and its role in facilitating cultural learning. For instance, cultural learning is enhanced by situating heritage artifacts in the experience, and embedding learning in the reward system. Engagement and collaboration among visitors are fostered by creating a sense of ownership and designing a diversity of goals.},

abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) has been attracting attention as a common platform for edge computing thanks to its architecture neutrality, sandboxing for security, and lightweight characteristics that fit the requirements for distributed and cooperated processing with heterogeneous compute nodes, which consist of edge devices and clouds. Virtual machine (VM) migration technology enables seamless and flexible workload offloading on edge-cloud collaboration, but unfortunately, VM migration among different Wasm runtimes is complicated since the Wasm standardization does not specify the implementation design of internal runtime very well. Nevertheless, many implementations of Wasm runtime already exist, and each has different characteristics. We therefore aim to implement a stateful VM migration among most of the major Wasm runtimes. In this work, we prototyped a VM migration mechanism between WasmEdge and WAMR to investigate the technical challenges and determine the feasibility of implementing the runtime-neutral VM migration. Our experimental results on heterogenous VM migration demonstrate the value of coexisting multiple runtimes well-suited for each edge and cloud and seamlessly offloading the workloads among them.},

Many systems have experimented citizen-sourcing in city governance processes; however, their maturity levels are mixed. In order to focus on the service maturity, we introduce a city service maturity framework that contains five levels of service support and two levels of information integration. As an example, we introduce CITY FEED, which implements citizen-sourcing in city issue management process. In order to support such process, CITY FEED supports all levels of the maturity framework (publishing, transacting, interacting, collaborating, and evaluating) and integrates related information relationally and heterogeneously. In order to integrate heterogeneous information, it implements a threefold feed deduplication mechanism based on the geographic, text semantic, and image similarities of feeds. Currently, CITY FEED is in a pilot stage.},

Current systems for infomobility services assume that most information is already available on the mobile device and the device connectivity is used for receiving critical messages from a central server. However, we argue that the next generation of infomobility services will be characterized by collaboration and interaction among the users, provided through real-time bidirectional communication between the client devices and the infomobility system.In this paper we propose an innovative architecture to support next generation infomobility services providing interaction and collaboration among the mobile users that can travel by several different transportation means, ranging from cars to trains to foot. We discuss the design issues of the architecture, with particular emphasis on scalability, availability and user data privacy, which are critical in a collaborative infomobility scenario.},

abstract = {In the BEAMING project we have been extending the scope of collaborative mixed reality to include the representation of users in multiple modalities, including augmented reality, situated displays and robots. A single user (a visitor) uses a high-end virtual reality system (the transporter) to be virtually teleported to a real remote location (the destination). The visitor may be tracked in several ways including emotion and motion capture. We reconstruct the destination and the people within it (the locals). In achieving this scenario, BEAMING has integrated many heterogeneous systems. In this paper, we describe the design and key implementation choices in the Beaming Scene Service (BSS), which allows the various processes to coordinate their behaviour. The core of the system is a light-weight shared object repository that allows loose coupling between processes with very different requirements (e.g. embedded control systems through to mobile apps). The system was also extended to support the notion of presence awareness. We demonstrate two complex applications built with the BSS.},

abstract = {Layered interactive systems lend themselves to be adapted for cooperation if inter-layer communication is charged to separated connectors. Point-to-point connectors can be replaced with cooperative connectors multiplexing and demultiplexing I/O between a particular layer and multiple instances of the next lower one. For this technique to be most effective, some general guidelines should be followed that support the design of good quality software where discrimination between heterogeneous functionality at the architectural level allows multiple interacting users to exploit different system features based on their role in the cooperation. This provides a sound basis for augmenting collaboration-transparent layered systems with powerful collaboration support (e.g. complex coordination policies) yet preserving separation of concerns between applicative and cooperative functionality. The paper discusses these issues both in general and with reference to their application within the CSDL framework for cooperative systems design.},

abstract = {Learning low-dimensional representations for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) has drawn increasing attention recently for its effectiveness in real-world applications. Compared with homogeneous networks, HINs are characterized by meta-paths connecting different types of nodes with semantic meanings. Existing methods mainly follow the prototype of independently learning meta-path-based embeddings and integrating them into a unified embedding. However, meta-paths in a HIN are inherently correlated since they reflect different perspectives of the same object. If each meta-path is treated as an isolated semantic data resource and the correlations among them are disregarded, sub-optimality in the both the meta-path based embedding and final embedding will be resulted. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to explicitly model the correlation among meta-paths by proposing Collaborative Knowledge Distillation for Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding (CKD). More specifically, we model the knowledge in each meta-path with two different granularities: regional knowledge and global knowledge. We learn the meta-path-based embeddings by collaboratively distill the knowledge from intra-meta-path and inter-meta-path simultaneously. Experiments conducted on six real-world HIN datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the CKD method.},

This research focuses on integrating different types of MR remote collaboration systems together allowing a new variety for remote collaboration to extend its features and user experience. In this demonstration, we present 360Drops, a MR remote collaboration system that uses 360 panorama images within 3D reconstructed scenes. We introduce a new technique to interact with multiple 360 Panorama Spheres in an immersive 3D reconstructed scene. This allows a remote user to switch between multiple 360 scenes “live/static, past/present,” placed in a 3D reconstructed scene to promote a better understanding of space and interactivity through verbal and nonverbal communication. We present the system features and user experience to the attendees of SIGGRAPH Asia 2019 through a live demonstration.},

abstract = {Successful knowledge integration, that is, systematic synthesis of unshared information, is key to suc-cess, but at the same time a challenging venture for teams with distributed knowledge collaborating online. For example, teams with heterogeneous knowledge often have only vague or even wrong ideas about who knows what. This situation is further complicated if the collaboration partners do not know each other and merely communicate online. Previous research has found meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge about one's own and the partner's knowledge areas, to be a promising but not yet sufficient-ly investigated approach to promote knowledge integration. With our experimental study we aimed to address this desideratum of research on the role of meta-knowledge in net-based collaborations. We "simulated" a chat-based collaboration between partners with heterogeneous knowledge by assigning specific information to students collaborating in dyads on a Hidden Profile task. To arrive at the correct joint solution for this task, collaborating partners had to pool their shared, but more importantly their unshared information. We compared two conditions: In the experimental condition meta-knowledge was promoted by providing the collaboration partners with self-presentations of each other's roles, which pointed to their unique fields of knowledge, while participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Results suggest a positive impact of the meta-knowledge manipulation on two key factors of collaboration: knowledge integration and construction of a transactive memory system (TMS).},

abstract = {Programming assignments in computer science courses are often processed in pairs or groups of students. While working together, students face several shortcomings in today's software: The lack of real-time collaboration capabilities, the setup time of the development environment, and the use of different devices or operating systems can hamper students when working together on assignments. Text processing platforms like Google Docs solve these problems for the writing process of prose text, and computational notebooks like Google Colaboratory for data analysis tasks. However, none of these platforms allows users to implement interactive applications. We deployed a web-based literate programming system for three months during an introductory course on application development to explore how collaborative programming practices unfold and how the structure of computational notebooks affect the development. During the course, pairs of students solved weekly programming assignments. We analyzed data from weekly questionnaires, three focus groups with students and teaching assistants, and keystroke-level log data to facilitate the understanding of the subtleties of collaborative programming with computational notebooks. Findings reveal that there are distinct collaboration patterns; the preferred collaboration pattern varied between pairs and even varied within pairs over the course of three months. Recognizing these distinct collaboration patterns can help to design future computational notebooks for collaborative programming assignments.},

In practice, analysis of these factors typically requires expertise of multidisciplinary teams. In this paper, we present a visualization system which aims to support the visual analytics process involving multidisciplinary teams of analysts in co-located collaborative settings. The current prototype system allows coupled and decoupled modes of interaction, using a combination of personal visualizations on private small displays and group visualizations on a shared large display. We have conducted preliminary fieldwork and a review study of this prototype with a group of medical experts who have provided feedback on the current system and suggestions for other usage scenarios, as well as further improvements. We found that our target user group have a generally positive attitude towards the use of a shared display with support for the suggested interaction modes, even though these modes are substantially different from the way their groups currently conduct synchronous collaboration, and that additional support for sharing image and textual data over the geospatial data layer may be required.},

abstract = {DevOps is an emerging paradigm to tightly integrate developers with operations personnel. This is required to enable fast and frequent releases in the sense of continuously delivering software. Users and customers of today's Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Beside cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to implement DevOps in practice, tooling is required to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is constantly pushing new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud. In this paper we present a systematic classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be transformed toward TOSCA, an emerging standard in this field. This enables the seamless and interoperable orchestration of arbitrary artifacts to model and deploy application topologies. We validate the presented approach by a prototype implementation, show its practical feasibility by a detailed case study, and evaluate its performance.},

However, even though being included with their sighted peers, previous research reveals concerns with classroom participation, lack of collaborative learning, reduced social engagement, and potential for isolation. My dissertation explores designing and building interactive social robots to promote inclusive classroom experiences and social engagement between children with mixed visual abilities. Social robots have the potential to foster engagement, participation, and collaboration due to their unique multi-sensory capabilities, actuators, and agency. Situated in a local mainstream school, I conducted extensive field work that involved engaging with the school community, including children, teachers, therapists, and parents through ethnographic observations, contextual inquiry, group interviews, and design activities. The identified challenges and opportunities will guide the design of social robots capable of supporting inclusive classroom experiences and sustaining long-term social engagement between mixed visual abilities' pupils. I will explore opportunities for off-the-shelf and custom-built robots to address existing challenges by following a user-centred methodology to design prototype, and evaluate solution with the school community.},

Development of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture and processors during the last ten years has made the implementation of a desktop computer using open hardware, including open processors, and open source software an approaching possibility. We use the SiFive Unmatched development board and Ubuntu Linux, and the recorded experiences of system builders using the Unmatched board to explore the extent to which it is possible to create an open desktop computer. The work identifies current limitations to implementing an open computer system, which lie mainly at the interface between the operating system and hardware components. Potential solutions to the challenges uncovered are proposed, including greater consideration of openness during the early stages of product design. A further contribution is made by an account of the synergies arising from open collaboration in a private-collective innovation process.},

However, remote socialization and collaboration as an alternative approach is still a great challenge for children. This paper presents MR.Brick, a Mixed Reality (MR) educational game system that helps children adapt to remote collaboration. A controlled experimental study involving 24 children aged six to ten was conducted to compare MR.Brick with the traditional video game by measuring their social and collaborative skills and analyzing their multi-modal playing behaviours. The results showed that MR.Brick was more conducive to children’s remote collaboration experience than the traditional video game. Given the lack of training systems designed for children to collaborate remotely, this study may inspire interaction design and educational research in related fields.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of storage and computing power on mobile devices, it becomes critical and popular to deploy models on devices to save onerous communication latencies and to capture real-time features. While quite a lot of works have explored to facilitate on-device learning and inference, most of them focus on dealing with response delay or privacy protection. Little has been done to model the collaboration between the device and the cloud modeling and benefit both sides jointly. To bridge this gap, we are among the first attempts to study the Device-Cloud Collaborative Learning (DCCL) framework. Specifically, we propose a novel MetaPatch learning approach on the device side to efficiently achieve "thousands of people with thousands of models'' given a centralized cloud model. Then, with billions of updated personalized device models, we propose a "model-over-models'' distillation algorithm, namely MoMoDistill, to update the centralized cloud model. Our extensive experiments over a range of datasets with different settings demonstrate the effectiveness of such collaboration on both cloud and devices, especially its superiority to model long-tailed users.},

abstract = {Recent work [Ives et al. 2005] proposed a new class of systems for supporting data sharing among scientific and other collaborations: this new collaborative data sharing system connects heterogeneous logical peers using a network of schema mappings. Each peer has a locally controlled and edited database instance, but wants to incorporate related data from other peers as well. To achieve this, every peer's data and updates propagate along the mappings to the other peers. However, this operation, termed update exchange, is filtered by trust conditions—expressing what data and sources a peer judges to be authoritative—which may cause a peer to reject another's updates. In order to support such filtering, updates carry provenance information.This article develops methods for realizing such systems: we build upon techniques from data integration, data exchange, incremental view maintenance, and view update to propagate updates along mappings, both to derived and optionally to source instances. We incorporate a novel model for tracking data provenance, such that curators may filter updates based on trust conditions over this provenance. We implement our techniques in a layer above an off-the-shelf RDBMS, and we experimentally demonstrate the viability of these techniques in the Orchestra prototype system.},

abstract = {Welcome to the Sixth ACM International Workshop on VehiculAr InterNETworking (VANET 2009) in Beijing! After the success of the previous five events, 2009 is a great year to continue this exciting and innovative workshop. The application of vehicle communication systems (vehicle-to-vehicle as well as vehicle-to- roadside) technologies have been presented in several impressive large-scale demonstrations during the past year and it appears that the technology is now closer than ever before to actual deployment. The VANET technology has the ability to be an outstanding milestone of improved safety and efficiency of transportation and logistics on the roads. VANET technology is now in a critical phase where academia, industry and governments worldwide are jointly investing significant time and resources in order to understand the technology and prepare for large scale deployment. However, several technical challenges remain that require resolution.The design of a VANET is a highly collaborative effort and one that involves multiple disciplines. Our experience has shown that this has a potential to lead to push-pulls of varying interests and requirements, both between engineering disciplines and non-engineering disciplines. One of the key objectives of VANET is to stimulate strong collaboration between different technical disciplines. It is only through a strong collaboration that it is possible to design and implement a VANET that provides the right balance of reliability, cost-efficiency, safety, security, control and privacy.This year we received 40 submissions for the regular program of the VANET workshop. Each paper was assigned to three TPC members and received at least three reviews. While for most papers the final decision was straight forward, some papers with heterogeneous reviews were discussed thoroughly by the TPC members. At the end, the TPC accepted 12 submissions as full papers while the authors of five submissions where invited to present their work as a poster paper. Due to space constraints and given the excellent quality of this year's submissions, we had to make very tough decisions during this selection process.},

We provide a prototype e-commerce solution, the Seicos system, based on the SecondLife client and the OpenSimulator server. In the system, semantic information is retrieved and integrated from multiple heterogeneous sources and subsequently cached and accessed using Semantic Web methods. The semantic information gathered by our system can support the customer and is integrated into a knowledge base which is used for processing queries.The conducted user study indicates that the system succeeds in providing a sense of co-presence to the customer, when searching for goods. The availability of additional semantic data on product related information is perceived particularly helpful.},

abstract = {For the past several years, the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL) at the University of Hawaii has been pursuing research along two general fronts: the development of computer systems to support group activities (collaborative software), as well as research on the process of developing software in a group setting (collaborative development). Our research projects include:• Egret, a client-server system for implementing domain-specific, collaborative, hypertext systems [1, 6, 7, 9];• CSRS, an Egret-based system for software review and quality improvement [2, 10, 11, 12, 8, 6, 7, 9];• AEN, an Egret-based system for collaborative authoring and learning [3];• CLARE, an Egret-based system collaborative learning and review [4, 13, 14, 15].• ICS-WWW, a WWW-based system for exploring community building through electronic means [5].From these experiences, we have be gun to recognize two fundamentally different styles of collaboration and collaborative system, which we term collaboration-in-t he-large and collaboration-in-the-small. Collaboration in the large, embodied by such systems as WWW, scales to thousands or millions of individuals. Such domain-independent scale requires a kind of collaborative "open world assumption": users do not know the answers to such elementary questions as: Who are the other users? What is the set of artifacts in the system? What has changed sinceyesterday? What is interesting to me? Is the information repository structurally consistent? What is user X doing right now?In contrast, the systems b uilt by our lab exploit the possibiliti es of domain-specific, collaboration-in-the- small where a "closed world assumption" holds. In our systems, in contrast to WWW, all of the preceeding questions have answers, at least relative to the domain of discourse embodied in the system. The cost of collaboration in the small is its lack of scalability both technically and socially: it is unlikely that groups of more than 50 or 100 could work together effectively in our systems, or that our system could provide adequate responsiveness to larger groups.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) presents a dynamic global revolution in the Internet where physical and virtual "things" communicate and share information. There arises a need to allow heterogeneous "things" to seamlessly interoperate, interact and exchange information and subsequently share services. Services are represented as functionalities that are offered by the "things". In IoT context, service orchestration refers to identifying which devices or software components are required to formulate the requested service. IoT devices can offer different services based on the context and semantics. Service orchestration provides an approach to integration and interoperability which decouples applications from each other, and enhances capabilities to centrally manage and monitor components. This paper investigates requirements for semantic interoperability and exposes current challenges in IoT interoperability as a means of facilitating services orchestration in IoT. The paper proposes a semantic platform that allows heterogeneous devices to collaborate thereby enabling dynamic service orchestration. The proposed platform provides a common ontology-based framework for representing semantics allowing for a consistent information exchange format. The approach used combines domain-specific ontologies to obtain device and service abstraction for the purposes of process mining and analysis of service orchestration in heterogonous IoT environments. This approach was evaluated using a prototype IoT environment and mining techniques developed in the Process Mining Framework (ProM). The results revealed that semantically enriching service annotation and device descriptions through ontologies can successfully enable interoperability in heterogeneous IoT environments. Semantically enriched descriptions enable multiple perspectives of analysis on service orchestration processes and expose the steps involved in service request and provision in an a typical IoT setup.},

abstract = {Among different recommendation techniques, collaborative filtering usually suffer from limited performance due to the sparsity of user-item interactions. To address the issues, auxiliary information is usually used to boost the performance. Due to the rapid collection of information on the web, the knowledge base provides heterogeneous information including both structured and unstructured data with different semantics, which can be consumed by various applications. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the heterogeneous information in a knowledge base to improve the quality of recommender systems. First, by exploiting the knowledge base, we design three components to extract items' semantic representations from structural content, textual content and visual content, respectively. To be specific, we adopt a heterogeneous network embedding method, termed as TransR, to extract items' structural representations by considering the heterogeneity of both nodes and relationships. We apply stacked denoising auto-encoders and stacked convolutional auto-encoders, which are two types of deep learning based embedding techniques, to extract items' textual representations and visual representations, respectively. Finally, we propose our final integrated framework, which is termed as Collaborative Knowledge Base Embedding (CKE), to jointly learn the latent representations in collaborative filtering as well as items' semantic representations from the knowledge base. To evaluate the performance of each embedding component as well as the whole system, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets from different scenarios. The results reveal that our approaches outperform several widely adopted state-of-the-art recommendation methods.},

In the latter context, stakeholders have varying levels of power causing asymmetry and possible suppression of one group over another. Such power differentials can hinder co-design’s effectiveness. Through thirteen semi-structured interviews with co-design facilitators who have worked with marginalized communities in 43 different countries, we discovered that despite efforts to mitigate power differentials, significant disparities in educational and cultural backgrounds, language barriers, and gender imbalances prevent true collaboration. Tools for prototyping, analysis and evaluation often require literacy, advanced training, and resources. When these are inaccessible, co-design fails to materialize in the design analysis, implementation, and evaluation phases. We found this failure occurred with marginalized groups. We also found that experienced facilitators were aware of their own privilege as well as the power differentials of outside stakeholders such as donors, and they prioritized strategies to address them ahead of time.},

abstract = {Data collaboration enables multiple parties to pool data for deriving meaningful data insights. However, data misuse and unlawful data collection have led to precautionary measures being imposed by individual organizations to guide against data leakage and abuse. As a response, decentralized federated learning (DFL) has emerged as an attractive paradigm to facilitate data collaboration while being amenable to privacy-preserving data and knowledge sharing, cost reduction, and prediction accuracy improvement. Unfortunately, the participating parties in DFL tend to be heterogeneous with skew datasets and uneven capabilities. Inevitably, training and transmission costs, and the presence of free-riders pose challenges to the adoption and participation of DFL. The absence of centralized parameter servers further exacerbates the problem of evaluating the contribution of each individual party. Therefore, an effective incentive mechanism is essential to promote data collaboration.In this paper, we propose a novel Incentive-aware Decentralized fEderated leArning (IDEA) framework for facilitating data collaboration. Specifically, we first design a customizable reward scheme for heterogeneous parties to optimize their respective objectives such as higher model accuracy, communication efficiency, and computational efficiency. To reward fairly to deserving parties while offering flexibility, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) incentive mechanism, which enables heterogeneous parties to learn their own optimal collaboration policy. We then design an efficient decentralized data collaboration algorithm that supports the customizable reward scheme based on individual objective-specific collaboration policy. We theoretically prove that the algorithm achieves a Nash equilibrium, which ensures the fairness of the corresponding rewards for parties. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework against four baselines on five real-world datasets. The results show that IDEA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and accumulated reward.},

While moments of crisis expose the vulnerabilities and injustices underlying this system, this paper seeks to explore which processes and tools CSCW could purposely design to 'open up' food infrastructures and bring young and adult people in contact with different aspects of the food system to cultivate food citizenship from a more-than-human perspective. Through a collaboration with a local primary school and four different food organisations (a mushroom grower, a vegetable farm, a bread-baking community centre, and a food bank) in North East England, UK, we designed 'contact zones' that enabled a class of students aged 7 to 8 years to encounter socio-material food practices at each partnering organisation's site and in the classroom. Our insights show young people's rich engagement in the socio-materiality of place, food, and practices; how encountering food practices across very different sites helped surface the interconnectedness of the food system; and how the contact zones opened spaces to practice food citizenship. The paper offers design implications towards infrastructuring more-than-human food pedagogies. It discusses inherent power dynamics of more-than-human design collaborations, critically evaluates the role of technology in more-than-human relations, and presents three design opportunities towards a relational understanding of food.},

This short paper introduces our architecture and approach to engineering a DART system so that we achieve high assurance in its runtime behavior against a set of formally specified requirements. It describes our technique to: (i) ensure asymmetric timing protection between high- and low-critical threads on each node in the DART system, and (ii) verify that the self-adaptation within, and coordination between, the nodes and their interaction with the physical environment do not violate high and low criticality requirements. We present our ongoing research to integrate advances in model-based engineering with compositional analysis techniques to formally verify safety-critical properties demanded in safety-conscious domains such as aviation and automotive; and introduce our DART model problem to demonstrate of our engineering approach.},

abstract = {Transparent displays can serve as an important collaborative medium supporting face-to-face interactions over a shared visual work surface. Such displays enhance workspace awareness: when a person is working on one side of a transparent display, the person on the other side can see the other's body, hand gestures, gaze and what he or she is actually manipulating on the shared screen. Even so, we argue that designing such transparent displays must go beyond current offerings if it is to support collaboration. First, both sides of the display must accept interactive input, preferably by at least touch and / or pen, as that affords the ability for either person to directly interact with the workspace items. Second, and more controversially, both sides of the display must be able to present different content, albeit selectively. Third (and related to the second point), because screen contents and lighting can partially obscure what can be seen through the surface, the display should visually enhance the actions of the person on the other side to better support workspace awareness. We describe our prototype FACINGBOARD-2 system, where we concentrate on how its design supports these three collaborative requirements.},

abstract = {Inter-domain collaborations comprise of a series of tasks, whose run-time environment stretches over heterogeneous systems governed by different set of policies and where participating organizations desire to preserve control over their resources. One of the major security challenges in modeling those inter-domain collaborations is providing a decentralized authorization solution. At the core of this challenge lie two problems: 1) an authorization decision maker does not know who a principal is and 2) which set of privileges this principal owns if the principal is originated from outside of the decision maker's domain. Currently, a number of different approaches tackle this problem and claim to provide a full-fledged solution. These approaches, however, often require particular use of infrastructures and their own policy languages. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model using the concept of distributed roles from the dRBAC model to bridge different domain boundaries. Based on e-Government collaboration scenarios, we identify a set of requirements of decentralized authorization and propose an extension to the current XACML specification as a realization of our model.},

abstract = {We show several aspects of a complex mixed reality system that we have built and deployed in a real-world factory setting. In our system, virtual worlds, augmented realities, and social and mobile applications are all fed from the same infrastructure. In collaboration with TCHO[1], a chocolate maker in San Francisco, we built a virtual "mirror" world of a real-world chocolate factory and its processes. Sensor data is imported into the multi-user 3D environment from hundreds of sensors on the factory floor. The resulting virtual factory is used for simulation, visualization, and collaboration, using a set of interlinked, real-time layers of information. Another part of our infrastructure is designed to support appropriate industrial uses for mobile devices such as cell phones and tablet computers. We deployed this system at the real-world factory in 2009, and it is now is daily use there. By simultaneously developing mobile, virtual, and web-based display and collaboration environments, we aimed to create an infrastructure that did not skew toward one type of application but that could serve many at once, interchangeably. Through this mixture of mobile, social, mixed and virtual technologies, we hope to create systems for enhanced collaboration in industrial settings between physically remote people and places, such as factories in China with managers in the US.},

Users are able to see 3D objects on the tabletop display anywhere around the table without 3D glasses. The system uses a visual perceptual mechanism for smooth motion parallax in the horizontal direction with fewer projectors than previous works. A 360-degree camera mounted above the table and image recognition software detects users' positions around the table and the heights of their faces (eyes) as they move around the table in real-time. Those mechanics help display correct vertical and horizontal direction motion parallax for different users simultaneously. Our system also has a user interaction function with a tablet device that manipulates 3D objects displayed on the table. These functions support collaborative work and communication between users. We implemented a prototype system and demonstrated the collaborative features of the 360-degree tabletop display system.},

MikiWiki is aimed at supporting End-User Development activities and exploring the opportunities to enable software tailoring at use time. Such an open-ended collaborative design process is realized by providing basic boundary object prototypes, allowing end users to remix, modify, and create their own boundary objects. Moreover, MikiWiki minimizes essential services at the server-side, while putting the main functionalities on the client-side, opening the whole system to its users for further tailoring. In addition to traditional wikis, MikiWiki allows different Communities of Practice to collaboratively design and to continuously evolve the whole system. This approach illustrates the meta-design concept, where some software collaboration between professional developers and end users is made possible through communication channels properly associated with the environment. As such, the MikiWiki environment is presented as a 'concept demonstrator' for meta-design and end-user tailoring.},

abstract = {Teamness is a newly proposed multidimensional construct aimed to characterize teams and their dynamic levels of interdependence over time. Specifically, teamness is deeply rooted in team cognition literature, considering how a team’s composition, processes, states, and actions affect collaboration. With this multifaceted construct being recently proposed, there is a call to the research community to investigate, measure, and model dimensions of teamness. In this study, we explored the speech content of 21 human-human-agent teams during a remote collaborative search task. Using self-report surveys of their social and affective states throughout the task, we conducted factor analysis to condense the survey measures into four components closely aligned with the dimensions outlined in the teamness framework: social dynamics and trust, affect, cognitive load, and interpersonal reliance. We then extracted features from teams’ speech using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and performed Epistemic Network Analyses (ENA) across these four teamwork components as well as team performance. We developed six hypotheses of how we expected specific LIWC features to correlate with self-reported team processes and performance, which we investigated through our ENA analyses. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses of the networks, we explore differences of speech patterns across the four components and relate these findings to the dimensions of teamness. Our results indicate that ENA models based on selected LIWC features were able to capture elements of teamness as well as team performance; this technique therefore shows promise for modeling of these states during CSCW, to ultimately design intelligent systems to promote greater teamness using speech-based measures.},

abstract = {Multi-party voice-over-IP (MVoIP) services provide economical and natural group communication mechanisms for many emerging applications such as on-line gaming, distance collaboration, and tele-immersion. In this paper, we present a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) stream processing system called peerTalk to provide resource-efficient and failure-resilient MVoIP services. Different from previous work, our solution is fully distributed and self-organizing without requiring specialized servers or IP multicast support. Particularly, we decouple the stream processing in MVoIP services into two phases: (1) aggregation phase that mixes audio streams from active speakers into a single stream; and (2) distribution phase that distributes the mixed audio stream to all listeners. The decoupled model allows us to optimize and adapt the P2P stream mixing and distribution processes separately. Specifically, we can adaptively spread stream mixing workload among resource-constrained peer hosts according to current speaking activities. We have implemented a prototype of the peerTalk system and conducted experiments in real-world wide-area networks. The results show that peerTalk can achieve lower resource contention and better service quality than previous common solution.},

In this work, we present the prototype of a gaze-supported multi-modal dialogue system that enhances two core tasks in human-robot collaboration: 1) our robot is able to learn new objects and their location from user instructions involving gaze, and 2) it can instruct the user to move objects and passively track this movement by interpreting the user's gaze. We performed a user study to investigate the impact of different eye trackers on user performance. In particular, we compare a head-worn device and an RGB-based remote eye tracker. Our results show that the head-mounted eye tracker outperforms the remote device in terms of task completion time and the required number of utterances due to its higher precision.},

abstract = {Crisis management requires the collaboration of a variety of people with different roles, often across organizational boundaries. It has been shown that geographic information systems can improve the efficiency of disaster management operations. However, workstation-based solutions fail to offer the same ease of collaboration as the large analog maps currently in use. Recent research prototypes, which use interactive tabletops for this purpose, often do not consider individual roles and the need for accountability of actions. In this paper, we present coMAP, a system built for interactive tabletops that facilitates collaborative situation analysis and planning in crisis management teams. Users can interact with coMAP using multi-touch as well as pen input. The latter is realized by new methods for the use of Anoto digital pens without the Anoto microdot pattern. A pen-optimized pie menu provides access to role-specific information and system functions. A combination of role-based access control and indoor tracking via Bluetooth is used to support accountability of actions while still allowing collaboration and information sharing. Initial user feedback for our system shows promising results.},

A mixed integer linear formulation is introduced and used to solve the problem model in a centralized iterative manner: in closed-loop, team-level plans are adaptively computed and sent out. Unfortunately, a centralized scheme can suffer from computational and communication shortcomings. Therefore, we introduce a top-down recipe for decentralization, aiming to balance the tradeoff among implementation costs, computational requirements, and quality of coordination. The decentralized architecture depends on various aspects that we study through an empirical sensitivity analysis. Results show that the impact and the relationships among the different aspects are far from being obvious or intuitive. A number of practical lessons are learned, that could apply to other similar problems and/or decentralized architectures derived in the same top-down modality.},

Traditionally, the use of DSLs has been limited to a static setting in desktop or web editors. However, in this paper, we claim that DSLs can be central components of mobile collaborative applications. In our vision, graphical DSLs can be extended to make use of mobility and context, and integrate heterogeneous information gathered from open APIs. We call this new generation languages "active DSLs".We foresee a range of scenarios where active DSLs can be useful. On the one hand, they can be used more flexibly in remote locations by enabling local collaboration of several mobile devices using their short-range communication capabilities. On the other hand, they can be extended with contextual features like geolocation, allowing the integration of maps and geo-services within the DSL, or the DSL rendering customization in response to contextual information. Active DSLs can also retrieve information from open APIs, in which case, models defined with the DSL become aggregators of heterogeneous data.In this paper, we explain our vision for active DSLs and the first steps towards its realization in the DSL-comet tool. The tool permits creating and using mobile graphical DSLs on iOS devices, and their seamless use in desktop environments.},

The most significant findings include a tendency for social innovation laboratories using different technologies to socialize knowledge and the use of collaboration tools for the collaborative construction of knowledge. Is has been found that the creation of citizen networks (open social networks, researcher networks or contributor networks) and interdisciplinary work groups is common. Experts in laboratories suggest participating in listening mode since they take into account the experience of those affected and non-experts.

abstract = {Nowadays, most if not all work concerning the technical development of products is aided by computer technology. CAD tools are used to construct the objects, high-quality rendering is used to visualise prototype designs, and most importantly, products are optimised using computational simulation methods. Ensuring the proper and optimal functioning of a future product requires the collaboration of human experts using a multitude of different tools. Computational meshes suitable for numerical simulations have to be created from geometry by meshing experts, boundary conditions -- i.e. parameters that define the different conditions a simulation should try to reproduce -- have to be defined, the simulation has to be started and monitored, and the results have to be analysed. All those steps usually use different tools and need special expertise and knowledge to use. This paper will show how to merge those steps usually performed by different tools into one coherent platform, and how to present the uniform access to this platform in a browser interface. This gives teams of engineers collaborative access to all parameters needed to influence the geometry creation, meshing, simulation on high- performance computing resources and post-processing of their simulation results, delivering these results directly into the web browser using modern WebGL and AJAX techniques. The web-based access introduced in this work also contributes to lowering the threshold for engineers to use remote simulation and post-processing facilities, allowing them to create and analyse data sets on their local workstation or mobile devices.In this paper, we will present a real-life scientific engineering work-flow from the field of turbo-machinery design to demonstrate the applicability of our solution for web-based collaborative interactive simulation and post-processing including a web-based 3D rendering environment.},

abstract = {Remote collaboration systems have become increasingly important in today’s society, especially during times when physical distancing is advised. Industry, research, and individuals face the challenging task of collaborating and networking over long distances. While video and teleconferencing are already widespread, collaboration systems in augmented, virtual, and mixed reality are still a niche technology. We provide an overview of recent developments of synchronous remote collaboration systems and create a taxonomy by dividing them into three main components that form such systems: Environment, Avatars, and Interaction. A thorough overview of existing systems is given, categorising their main contributions to help researchers working in different fields by providing concise information about specific topics such as avatars, virtual environment, visualisation styles, and interaction. The focus of this work is clearly on synchronised collaboration from a distance. A total of 87 unique systems for remote collaboration are discussed, including more than 100 publications and 25 commercial systems.},

abstract = {The design of interactive systems, especially in distributed joint research projects, is a challenging process in which many concepts are developed with successful outcomes but also with dissatisfying results. In order to structure and relay knowledge about good or bad approaches, design patterns are a well-known instrument in research and development. Due to the condition that a design pattern must be easy to read, different stakeholders in the system engineering and design process are able to understand the described concepts without the need of specific expert knowledge. In joint distributed research projects, application design knowledge may be scattered and documented in different manners. This means, before we can start formulating patterns, we need to discover and gather the available and partially concealed design knowledge. Since these fragments of knowledge may not always be accurately formulated for being used as design patterns, we seek for a collaborative method for collecting and formulating early findings together with established design knowledge. In this paper we present a concept of an evolutionary process for capturing, formulating, refining and validating design patterns. Our approach aims at involving as many stakeholders as possible in order to shape a pattern language over a project's lifetime in a collaborative process allowing facile participation. We implement our approach in the scope of the EU research project BRIDGE that aims at supporting inter-agency collaboration during emergency response and present the current state of our design pattern library prototype.},

abstract = {Healthcare information system involves a wide range of collaboration among distributed organizations such as home care organizations, wound care clinics and outpatient surgery facilities which often needs to access to patient medical data which is distributed across several components, structured in multiple data models or formats and with different semantics and stored in heterogeneous feeder systems. The nature of heterogeneous and distributed in healthcare environment causes severe semantic conflicts whenever electronic patient data exchange is needed. It is essential that these components be able to inter-operate with each other and facilitated in heterogeneous medical information exchange over the internet while reducing patient care cost and meanwhile improving the efficiency of patient diagnose. This paper proposed a schema matching approach not only reconcile semantic conflicts but also bring integrated access to patient medical data by mapping dispersed patient information which is semantically match and presenting it to authorized healthcare user.},

abstract = {Modern Internet services are often complex, large-scale distributed systems that consist of multiple software modules which may be developed by different teams using different programming languages. This multi-team collaboration and multiple development languages have brought new challenges to distributed program testing tools. Traditional manual testing cannot meet the testing requirements of large-scale distributed systems, and automated testing tools are usually used to complete testing tasks. This paper believes that enterprises with separate development and testing teams are more suitable to apply interface testing to realize automatic testing, and have designed and implemented a set of interface-oriented distributed automated testing systems—aSIT. Existing automated testing tools cannot well support scenarios such as internal heterogeneous service integration, multi-team collaboration, environmental network isolation, and massive test case execution. aSIT combined with actual engineering practice has carried out some specific designs to solve the above problems, so that it can be applied in the enterprise and improve the efficiency of the test team. After nearly 10 months of continuous using within the enterprise, testers can focus on use case design, the defect verification time was reduced to 1% of manual testing, the number of regression test cases increased by 30 times, and the average requirement delivery time was reduced by 63%.},

While drones have great potential for remote collaborative work and aerial telepresence, existing drone technology is limited in its support for synchronous collaboration among multiple remote users. Through three design iterations and evaluations, we prototyped Squadrone, a novel aerial telepresence platform that supports synchronous mid-air collaboration among multiple remote users. We present our design and report results from evaluating our iterations with 13 participants in 3 different collaboration configurations. Our first design iteration validates the basic functionality of the platform. Then, we establish the effectiveness of collaboration using a 360-degree shared aerial display. Finally, we simulate a type of search task in an open environment to see if collaborative telepresence impacts members’ participation. The results validate some initial goals for Squadrone and are used to reflect back on a recent telepresence design framework.},

abstract = {This paper presents Kahawai1, a system that provides high-quality gaming on mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, by offloading a portion of the GPU computation to server-side infrastructure. In contrast with previous thin-client approaches that require a server-side GPU to render the entire content, Kahawai uses collaborative rendering to combine the output of a mobile GPU and a server-side GPU into the displayed output. Compared to a thin client, collaborative rendering requires significantly less network bandwidth between the mobile device and the server to achieve the same visual quality and, unlike a thin client, collaborative rendering supports disconnected operation, allowing a user to play offline - albeit with reduced visual quality.Kahawai implements two separate techniques for collaborative rendering: (1) a mobile device can render each frame with reduced detail while a server sends a stream of per-frame differences to transform each frame into a high detail version, or (2) a mobile device can render a subset of the frames while a server provides the missing frames. Both techniques are compatible with the hardware-accelerated H.264 video decoders found on most modern mobile devices. We implemented a Kahawai prototype and integrated it with the idTech 4 open-source game engine, an advanced engine used by many commercial games. In our evaluation, we show that Kahawai can deliver gameplay at an acceptable frame rate, and achieve high visual quality using as little as one-sixth of the bandwidth of the conventional thin-client approach. Furthermore, a 50-person user study with our prototype shows that Kahawai can deliver the same gaming experience as a thin client under excellent network conditions.},

In this work, we present the prototype of a gaze-supported multi-modal dialogue system that enhances two core tasks in human-robot collaboration: 1) our robot is able to learn new objects and their location from user instructions involving gaze, and 2) it can instruct the user to move objects and passively track this movement by interpreting the user's gaze. We performed a user study to investigate the impact of different eye trackers on user performance. In particular, we compare a head-worn device and an RGB-based remote eye tracker. Our results show that the head-mounted eye tracker outperforms the remote device in terms of task completion time and the required number of utterances due to its higher precision.},

But, their small form-factor may impact the effectiveness of the visual feedback channel often used to help users maintain an awareness of their partner's activities during synchronous collaborative tasks. We investigated how visual and tactile feedback affects collaboration on mobile devices, with emphasis on spatial coordination in a shared workspace. From two user studies, our results highlight different benefits of each feedback channel in collaborative handheld systems. Visual feedback can provide precise spatial information for collaborators, but degrades collaboration when the feedback is occluded, and sometimes can distract the user's attention. Spatial tactile feedback can reduce the overload of information in visual space and gently guides the user's attention to an area of interest. Our results also show that visual and tactile feedback can complement each other, and systems using both feedback channels can support better spatial coordination than systems using only one form of feedback.},

This paper presents a conceptual framework for the systematic design of such systems in symbiotic environments. It distinguishes between information and interaction spaces. Focusing on using devices together, we introduce relationships between interaction spaces and annotatable mappings between the information space and the interaction spaces. Customizable annotations and the corresponding transformation of information support the development of collaborative systems for different scenarios. To demonstrate the validity of our framework, we introduce an architecture for multi-device web-browsing systems, and an annotation vocabulary which particularly focuses on symbiotic environments. The evaluation of our implemented prototype confirms the usefulness of multi-browsing, and the need for supporting both developers and end users to individually annotate web pages.},

abstract = {This volume contains papers selected for presentation at the 8th International Conference on New Technologies in Distributed Systems (NOTERE 2008) which took place in Lyon, France on June 23- 27, 2008.Systems have been evolving from pre-defined, monolithic, centralized architectures to increasingly decentralized, distributed, and dynamically composed federations of components. New applications, such as global supply-chain management and complex health-care systems, impose major research challenges in integration, interoperability, discovery, negotiation, collaboration, and optimization. Distributed and mobile collaboration technologies are beginning to allow people to move across organizational boundaries and to interact within and across organizations as well as communities, creating virtual communities or so-called "social networks". These virtual systems require sophisticated collaboration functionalities. Service-oriented architectures are emerging as a possible solution to build smart networks and enable grid and on-demand computing. The fast evolution of wireless technologies drives demand to extend interaction between users and mobile devices to the interaction with objects and services in the everyday world, opening thus the opportunity for context-aware and ubiquitous computing. Wireless Internet, mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks are seen as new platforms for future distributed and pervasive systems, exacerbating in turn the problems of privacy and security. Software processes are evolving from pre-specified sequential work-flows to decentralized and multi-organization collaborative endeavors. Business environments demand increased flexibility, dependability, fault-tolerance, and autonomy of involved heterogeneous systems. While significant progress has been achieved in distributed systems, new and adaptive technologies are needed to meet the fast evolving requirements and challenges presented by a myriad of new applications.The International Conference on New Technologies in Distributed Systems (NOTERE) is a bilingual (French/English) forum intended to bring together researchers and practitioners who are actively engaged both in theoretical and practical aspects of New Technologies in distributed systems. The main objective is to provide an effective forum for exchanging up-to-date information and experiences in distributed systems and debating issues and directions for further research and development.NOTERE 2008 received 97 submissions from all over the world including Algeria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, and USA. After a thorough review process for each submission by the Program Committee members and expert reviewers recommended by PC members, NOTERE 2008 chairs accepted 31 full research papers and 3 short research papers resulting in an acceptance rate of 36%. This volume also includes NOTERE 2008 DEMO papers.The NOTERE 2008 conference was supported by Lyon 1 University, INSA of Lyon, Lyon 2 University, IUT A of Lyon, ISTASE Institute in Saint-Etienne, LIRIS Laboratory, the French ministry of high education and research, France Telecom R&amp;D, MAIF, the local "Conseil Regional du Rh\^{o}ne", the local "Conseil G\'{e}neral du Rh\^{o}ne", and the city of Villeurbanne.},

In order to validate our approach, experiments were designed with a group of students and the outcomes were tested with an e-Learning system. The auto-grouping mechanism is developed using GA for better learning results, which is justified based on the performance of students tested on the e-Learning system. The outcomes clearly indicate that the proposed approach can generate a high degree of heterogeneous grouping and encourage students to learn better. The technical contribution of this article can be implemented in any massive open online course platforms with thousands of students, with regard to identifying peers for collaborative works.},

abstract = {There has been recent interest in the design of collaborative learning activities that are distributed across multiple technology devices for students to engage in scientific inquiry. Emerging research has begun to investigate students’ collaborative behaviors across different device types and students’ shared attention by tracking eye gaze, body posture, and their interactions with the digital environment. Using a 3D astronomy simulation that leverages a VR headset and tablet computers, this paper builds on the ideas described in eye-gaze studies by developing and implementing a metric of shared viewing across multiple devices. Preliminary findings suggest that a higher level of shared view could be related to increased conceptual discussion, as well as point to an early-stage pattern of behavior of decreased SV to prompt facilitator intervention to refocus collaborative efforts. We hope this metric will be a promising first step in further understanding and assessing the quality of collaboration across multiple device platforms in a single shared space. This paper provides an in depth look at a highly exploratory stage of a broader research trajectory to establish a robust, effective way to track screen views, including providing resources to teachers when students engage in similar learning environments, and providing insight from log data to understand how students effectively collaborate.},

abstract = {The whiteboard is essential for collaborative work. To preserve its physicality in remote collaboration, Mixed Reality (MR) can blend real whiteboards across distributed spaces. Going beyond reality, MR can further enable interactions like panning and zooming in a virtually reconfigurable infinite whiteboard. However, this reconfigurability conflicts with the sense of physicality. To address this tension, we introduce Blended Whiteboard, a remote collaborative MR system enabling reconfigurable surface blending across distributed physical whiteboards. Blended Whiteboard supports a unique collaboration style, where users can sketch on their local whiteboards but also reconfigure the blended space to facilitate transitions between loosely and tightly coupled work. We describe design principles inspired by proxemics; supporting users in changing between facing each other and being side-by-side, and switching between navigating the whiteboard synchronously and independently. Our work shows exciting benefits and challenges of combining physicality and reconfigurability in the design of distributed MR whiteboards.},

abstract = {Developing systems to support remote collaboration usually involves creating new environments in which non-co-located participants produce actions that are, at least in part, accessible to one another. However, this typically fractures the relationship between those actions and the sense of a shared environment, engendering difficulties that can render even the simplest of activities problematic. This becomes more pronounced as the activities become more complex and involve physical artifacts. Although mixed reality seems to offer promising ways of overcoming these troubles, there is still a risk of replicating the fractured ecology problem. We report on an empirical study and the development of a mixed reality prototype called BeamLite that seeks to bypass such issues by providing participants with the illusion of them sharing a single familiar place. Although our evaluation revealed possibilities for evading some troubles associated with artifact-focused remote collaboration, it exposed the need for virtual toolboxes that dynamically support specific work practices and the importance of virtual artifacts embedded within the physical environment to further diminish the sense of ecological fracture.},

The design case shows that cross-competence, collaborative teamwork, inspiring design contexts and collaborative making are quintessential to scaffold participants' knowledge and skills. However, in order to fully contribute to the design process, participants have to be involved at specific stages of design: domain experts are fundamental in an early design stage and during testing, whilst children are effective co-designers during middle stages when prototypes are available. Designers have the fundamental role of materialising ideas with aesthetic qualities and drive the co-creation process.},

abstract = {How does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? Results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. The difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. We address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: GitHub and Wikipedia. By analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. This effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. People tend to do more when collaborating with more people. We propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. The proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in GitHub and Wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration.},

We address this issue from a different angle and describe the concept and architecture of a pervasive document editing and managing system. It exploits database techniques and real-time updating for sophisticated collaboration scenarios on multiple devices. Each user is always served with up-to-date documents and can organize his work based on document meta data. For this, we present our conceptual architecture for such a system and discuss it with an example.},

Typical VO based authorization schemes is not suitable for such a user organized scientific collaboration. Using the emerging OAuthprotocol, we introduce a novel group authorization scheme to support ad-hoc team formation and user controlled resource sharing. Integrating this group authorization scheme, we define an Open Social based scientific collaboration framework and develop a science gateway prototype named as Open Life Science Gateway (OLSGW) to verify and refine the framework. Our experience with development of the OLSGW shows that OAuth 2.0 based group authorization scheme is avery promising approach to resource sharing in Cloud environments, and the Open Social based framework can facilitate science gateway developers to create domain-specific collaborative applications in a very flexible way.},

We report on a Wizard of Oz lab study in which 27 pairs of participants collaborated on search tasks over the Slack messaging platform. To complete tasks, pairs of collaborators interacted with a so-called searchbot with conversational capabilities. The role of the searchbot was played by a reference librarian. It is widely accepted that conversational search systems should be able to engage in mixed-initiative interaction ---take and relinquish control of a multi-agent conversation as appropriate. Research in discourse analysis differentiates between dialog- and task-level initiative. Taking dialog-level initiative involves leading a conversation for the sole purpose of establishing mutual belief between agents. Conversely, taking task-level initiative involves leading a conversation with the intent to influence the goals of the other agent(s). Participants in our study experienced three searchbot conditions, which varied based on the level of initiative the human searchbot was able to take: (1) no initiative, (2) only dialog-level initiative, and (3) both dialog- and task-level initiative. We investigate the effects of the searchbot condition on six different types of outcomes: (RQ1) perceptions of the searchbot's utility, (RQ2) perceptions of workload, (RQ3) perceptions of the collaboration, (RQ4) patterns of communication and collaboration, and perceived (RQ5) benefits and (RQ6) challenges from engaging with the searchbot.},

Virtual collaboration systems are complex and can be considered as social-technical systems, oftentimes encompassing several layers of both technical and social issues. If this multi-layered social-technical system is to work effectively and provide a dependable service, then all the layers must be well understood and structured accordingly. Otherwise, these layers can become barriers to virtual collaboration if they impede the collaborating users of a virtual team from attaining their goals. An amalgamation of principles from life-cycle and ethnomethodologically informed ethnography approaches in the evaluation of a virtual collaborative system is demonstrated in a case-study to enable researchers to understand what these issues are and how the different types of issues can prevent effective virtual collaboration.},

Despite recent advances in telecommunications, surgeons still have limited tools to remotely help inexperienced surgeons. Mixed Reality hints at a future where remote collaborators work side-by-side as if co-located; however, we still do not know how current technology can improve remote surgical collaboration. Through role-playing and iterative-prototyping, we identify collaboration practices used by expert surgeons to aid novice surgeons as well as technical requirements to facilitate these practices. We then introduce ARTEMIS, an AR-VR collaboration system that supports these key practices. Through an observational study with two expert surgeons and five novice surgeons operating on cadavers, we find that ARTEMIS supports remote surgical mentoring of novices through synchronous point, draw, and look affordances and asynchronous video clips. Most participants found that ARTEMIS facilitates collaboration despite existing technology limitations explored in this paper.},

However, less is known on how exactly the distribution of control among multiple users influences social interaction and collaboration in physically, shared environments. In this paper, we investigate five concepts of social control and their implementations in an exemplary use case of creating a shared music playlist using in-car infotainment systems. Testing the social control concepts in a mixed-subject experiment (N = 27), we assessed their effects on social connectedness, as an indication of social interaction and collaboration. The results show that both Consensual and Autocratic control improve social connectedness and the collaborative experience. In contrast, Anarchic and Token-Ring control obstructed the perceived connectedness mainly due to overruling other users’ decisions. Discussing the results, the paper draws further implications on how the concepts may improve social connectedness in co-located collaborative settings.},

We introduce co-Activity Manager, an activity-centric desktop system that (i) provides tools for ad hoc dynamic configuration of a desktop working context, (ii) supports both explicit and implicit articulation of ongoing work through a built-in collaboration manager and (iii) provides the means to coordinate and share working context with other users and devices. In this paper, we discuss the activity theory informed design of co-Activity Manager and report on a 14 day field deployment in a multi-disciplinary software development team. The study showed that the activity-centric workspace supports different individual and collaborative work configuration practices and that activity-centric collaboration is a two-phase process consisting of an activity sharing and per-activity coordination phase.},

While the proposed system, called SemWIQ (Semantic Web Integrator and Query Engine) is primarily designed for sharing data for scientific collaboration, it is regarded as a base technology useful for many other Semantic Web applications which use ontologies to describe highly-structured data.At its core, SemWIQ is based on the mediator-wrapper architecture and a specialized SPARQL query processor which is able to virtually integrate data using declarative queries (Note: SPARQL is a standardized declarative query language for the Semantic Web). Combined with latest research towards new graphical user interfaces for the Web of Data, the proposed approach is very well suited for large-scale collaborative knowledge sharing in research as well as in the industry.},

abstract = {The continuous growth of the number of cyber attacks along with the massive increase of mobile devices creates a highly heterogeneous landscape in terms of security challenges. We argue that in order for security researchers to cope with both the massive amount and the complexity of attacks, a more pro-active approach has to be taken into account. In addition, distributed attacks that are carried out by interconnected attackers require a collaborative defense. Diverging from traditional security defenses, honeypots are systems whose value lies on in being attacked and compromised. In this paper, we extend the idea of HosTaGe, i.e., a low interaction honeypot for mobile devices. Our system is specifically designed in a user-centric manner and runs out-of-the-box in the Android operating system. We present the design rational and discuss the different attack surfaces that HosTaGe is able to handle. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the collaborative capabilities of HosTaGe.},

abstract = {Video captioning is a core technology to many important applications, such as AI-assisted medical diagnosis, video question answering, storytelling through videos, and lip-reading. Video captioning employs a hybrid CNN + RNN model. Accelerating such a hybrid model on a heterogeneous system is challenging for two reasons. First, CNN and RNN exhibit very different computing behaviors, making the mapping between computation and heterogeneous devices difficult. Second, data dependency exists between the CNN and RNN within a video frame and between adjacent RNNs across video frames. These data dependencies prohibit the full parallelization of the hybrid model. The issues also include the utilization of accelerator resources, which is critical to maximizing the performance. In this work, we propose a fine-grained scheduling scheme for mapping computation and devices within a video frame, and a pipeline scheduling scheme for exploiting maximum parallelism between the execution of the video frames. In addition, we propose two capacity-guided scheduling methods. On the server, the concurrent kernel execution mechanism is exploited for improving GPU utilization. On the edge platform, we rearrange CNN computation among the CPU and EdgeTPUs guided by the EdgeTPU’s SRAM capacity so that balanced computation is achieved and off-chip memory overhead is minimized. Experimental results show that our scheduling scheme improves video captioning performance by up to 3.24 ( times )  with CPU + GPU collaboration over the GPU-only execution. On an edge platform with an ARM CPU and two EdgeTPUs, our CPU + EdgeTPU scheduling exhibits outstanding performance, which achieves up to 54.9 ( times )  speedup compared to using ARM CPU only and can perform video captioning of 59 frames per second.},

Twenty-two participants were instructed to perform a shared goal task. They worked in co-located pairs on solving three sets of two jigsaw puzzles concurrently. They were allowed to use any combination of direct and indirect input device, i.e., touch and mouse, to achieve the goal. Additionally, a hidden task was imposed on the participants in the second and third puzzle task: They had to discover that pieces were mixed up between the two displayed puzzles. The role of the hidden task was to trigger spontaneous transitions from individual to collaborative work. Our observations focused on the participants' selection and usage of input devices during the task execution. Our study revealed amongst others that participants stuck to their preferred input device even when they got more engaged in coordination and communication with their partner. Our findings are based on log data, questionnaire data and video recordings.},

Team collaboration presents unique challenges which are further exacerbated when such collaboration occurs in high-tempo environments that require “lean” communication affordances because they are not suited to traditional methods of rich communication such as text-based chat. Competitive multiplayer games can provide unique insights into how virtual teams communicate with limited communication affordance and under stress. In this work, we employed a mixed-method analysis of specific communication tools in a popular MOBA game Heroes of the Storm. Our study focuses on how players of the game use a gesturing communication system, called “Pings”, an example of lean communication affordance, to communicate within a team and its impact on team performance. We found that players appropriate the pings in distinct ways and exhibit different communication styles and these styles have different effects on the overall team performance. Our findings have implications for the design of emerging communication tools for virtual teams and can serve as guidelines to optimize communication in virtual teams.},

We give a theoretical guarantee that the sampling size depends on the error-bound ε, the confidence level (1-δ), and the path length T of each random walk. We perform an extensive empirical study on a Tencent microblogging network of 1,000,000,000 edges. We show that our algorithm can return top-k similar vertices for any vertex in a network 300\texttimes{} faster than the state-of-the-art methods.

abstract = {Software is becoming pervasive thanks to the increasing availability of computing power on many different devices, each with different capabilities in terms of display, storage space, mobility, and operating system. A driving vision is collaboration and cooperation among multiple devices, each with tasks tailored to their users and capabilities. Managing the complexity creating this vision naturally leads to the development of stable middleware frameworks to help developers address issues such as scale, heterogeneity, dynamicity, and composability.To support advanced applications, middleware incorporates research results from areas such as distributed computing, object-oriented design methods and programming languages, network security etc. This combination introduces new challenges for infrastructure developers. Hence, application developers must adapt their development methodologies to benefit from the advances made by infrastructure developers. Software Engineers are therefore challenged both in the area of infrastructure development, where open, heterogeneous, component-based platforms must provide richer functionality and services, and in the area of application development, where it is necessary to provide engineering solutions of proven practice for issues peculiar to systems based on such technologies.Software Engineering and Middleware is the premier workshop for the research and practice community of software engineering working in both areas to present and discuss new ideas in this field. SEM 2005 was the fifth international workshop of the EDO/SEM workshop series and it was held in Lisbon, Portugal in conjunction with ESEC/FSE 2005. Previous workshops of this series were held in 2004, 2002, 2000, and 1999.The 2005 program consisted of 16 technical papers selected from a total of 28 submissions. The submission, review, discussion, and selection process were held entirely electronically with support from the Paperdyne Conference Management System.

However, supporting the reuse process in complex and dynamic contexts, where future use of information is difficult to predict, is challenging. Collaborative analytics exemplifies such a context. We employed distributed cognition theory to design a collaborative visual analytics system, called AnalyticStream, for facilitating reuse of analysis outcomes. In contrast with the commonly used detail-oriented approach to applying distributed cognition, we performed a high level analysis of the design situation and we identified the cognitive processes that could be distributed over people to facilitate their collaboration. We examined some of the ideas derived from the theoretical analysis, by designing a simple reminding process through recommending relevant pieces of analysis, as well as a mechanism for attention management through allowing users greater control over their shared activity streams. A mixed-methods study of AnalyticStream showed that suggesting relevant artefacts facilitated discovering and consequently reusing them, and provided context-relevant awareness of other analysts' activities.},

abstract = {Workplace collaboration often requires interruptions, which can happen at inopportune times. Designing a successful availability-sharing system requires finding the right balance to optimize the benefits and reduce costs for both the interrupter and interruptee. In this paper, we examine the design space of availability-sharing systems and identify six relevant design dimensions: abstraction, presentation, information delivery, symmetry, obtrusiveness and temporal gradient. We describe these dimensions in terms of the tensions between interrupters and interruptees revealed in previous studies of workplace collaboration and deployments of awareness systems. As a demonstration of the utility of our design space, we introduce InterruptMe, a novel availability-sharing system that represents a previously unexplored point in the design space and that balances the tensions between interrupters and interruptees. InterruptMe differs from previous systems in that it displays availability information only when needed by monitoring implicit inputs from the system's users, implements a traceable asymmetry structure, and introduces the notion of per-communications channel availability.},

Qanaat presents data collections that enable any subset of enterprises involved in a collaboration workflow to keep their collaboration private from other enterprises. A transaction ordering scheme is also presented to enforce only the necessary and sufficient constraints on transaction order to guarantee data consistency. Furthermore, Qanaat supports data consistency across collaboration workflows where an enterprise can participate in different collaboration workflows with different sets of enterprises.

To support collaboration among occupants in future vehicles, research suggests interactive systems controlled by several users at once. In this paper, we explore five concepts for the collaborative performance of NDRA with the use-case of music playlist creation. While prior work investigated the effect on social connectedness, we expand insights towards team performance and fairness. Results from a mixed-subject experiment (N=27) show that the concepts have major consequences on team performance and fairness. Certain concepts can promote or hinder coordination effectiveness and, in turn, impact intra-vehicular collaboration. Our observations also indicate that fairness is key to fostering social collaboration in AVs, while it does not naturally define a high team performance. Subsequently, we provide recommendations to guide future designs of collaborative NDRAs in vehicles.},

abstract = {The increasing demand for edge computing has led to the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) models on IoT devices. However, due to data privacy and communication cost concerns, AI models are often offloaded from the cloud to the edge or device side. To improve the sensing capability of local models, this paper proposes a collaborative inference framework, Cosen, which organizes collaborative inference groups among multiple neighboring IoT devices. The framework utilizes group decisions to achieve higher accuracy and more robust global inference. Focusing on improving the efficiency of collaborative inference, this paper proposes a model design scheme based on inference time constraints to design local models for heterogeneous IoT devices. A model training method based on knowledge distillation is used to improve the accuracy of the local model. Cosen also proposes a dynamic deep ensemble management approach that further improves the robustness of the system. Preliminary experimental results show that Cosen achieves higher accuracy and robustness for global inference.},

abstract = {This proposal is about a study we recently published in the IEEE Transaction of Software Engineering journal [4].Context: Collaborative software engineering (CoSE) deals with methods, processes and tools for enhancing collaboration, communication, and co-ordination (3C) among team members [5]. CoSE can be employed to conceive different kinds of artifacts during the development and evolution of software systems. For instance, when focusing on software design, multiple stakeholders with different expertise and responsibility collaborate on the system design. Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) provides suitable techniques and tools for specifying, manipulating, and analyzing modeling artifacts including metamodels, models, and transformations [1]. Collaborative MDSE consists of methods or techniques in which multiple stakeholders manage, collaborate, and are aware of each others' work on a set of shared models. A collaborative MDSE approach is composed of three main complementary dimensions: (i) a model management infrastructure for managing the life cycle of the models, (ii) a set of collaboration means for allowing involved stakeholders to work on the modelling artifacts collaboratively, and (iii) a set of communication means for allowing involved stakeholders to exchange, share, and communicate information within the team. Collaborative MDSE is attracting several research efforts from different research areas (e.g., model-driven engineering, global software engineering, etc.), resulting in a variegated scientific body of knowledge on the topic.Objective: In this study we aim at identifying, classifying, and understanding existing collaborative MDSE approaches. More specifically, our goal is to assess (i) the key characteristics of collaborative MDSE approaches (e.g., model editing environments, model versioning mechanisms, model repositories, support for communication and decision making), (ii) their faced challenges and limitations, and (iii) the interest of researchers in collaborative MDSE approaches over time and their focus on the three dimensions of collaborative MDSE.Method: In order to achieve this, we designed and conducted a systematic mapping study [6] on collaborative MDSE. Starting from over 3,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure [3] resulting in 106 selected papers, further clustered into 48 primary studies, along a time span of nineteen years. A suitable classification framework has been empirically defined and rigorously applied for extracting key information from each selected study. We collated, summarized, and analyzed extracted data by applying scientifically sound data synthesis techniques.Results: In addition to a number of specific insights, our analysis revealed the following key findings: (i) there is a growing scientific interest on collaborative MDSE in the last years; (ii) multi-view modeling, validation support, reuse, and branching are more rarely covered with respect to other aspects about collaborative MDSE; (iii) different primary studies focus differently on individual dimensions of collaborative MDSE (i.e., model management, collaboration, and communication); (iv) most approaches are language-specific, with a prominence of UML-based approaches; (v) few approaches support the interplay between synchronous and asynchronous collaboration.Conclusion: This study gives a solid foundation for a thorough identification and comparison of existing and future approaches for collaborative MDSE [2]. Those results can be used by both researchers and practitioners for identifying existing research/technical gaps to attack, better scoping their own contributions to the field, or better understanding or refining existing ones.},

Home-based healthcare is such an example of leveraging pervasive sensors and analyzing sensor data (often in real-time) to guide therapy or intervene. In this paper, we address the challenges in regulatory compliance when designing and deploying healthcare applications on a heterogeneous cloud environment. We propose the CareNet framework, consisting of a set of APIs and secure data transmission mechanisms, to facilitate the specification of home-based healthcare services running on the software-defined infrastructure (SDI). This work is a collaboration among computer scientists, medical researchers, healthcare IT and healthcare providers, and its goal is to reduce the gap between the availability of SDI and meeting regulatory compliance in healthcare applications. Our prototype demonstrates the feasibility of the framework and serves as testbed for novel experimental studies of emerging healthcare applications.},

To investigate whether user perceptions of the two different versions differ, we conducted an experiment with 18 participants (9 pairs) and conducted a survey and semi-structured interviews. The results did not show significant differences between the two versions, but produced interesting insights. Based on the findings, we provide design guidelines for collaborative AR systems.},

abstract = {The joint effort of scientific collaborations and the expanding data market creates demand for high-performance and data-intensive analytics infrastructures that can exploit the potential of heterogeneous multi-core architectures with dynamic and scalable execution environments. Contemporary approaches focus on developing efficient parallel application models, but lack the flexibility of efficiently integrating and utilizing native or accelerator-based code. In this work, we illustrate a novel approach on mending this shortcoming and offering seamless application integration into a highly versatile execution infrastructure. The centerpiece is a framework of containerized execution units and management thereof for satisfying the diverse requirements of data analytics pipelines and its stages. Containers not only ease distribution and deployment of applications, but, more importantly enable an efficient synthesis of different stage implementation variants aimed towards exploiting heterogeneous computing resources. Consequently, this approach allows the infrastructure to utilize mainstream data and compute-intensive techniques and paradigms to achieve the goal of efficient pipeline execution. We present our approach in form of a requirement analysis, a multi-tier architecture description, and deployment scenarios based on our current prototype implementation.},

abstract = {Data mining efforts are getting beyond the area of databases. They have been focusing on data collected in fields like art, design, hypermedia and digital media production, case-based reasoning and computational modeling of creativity, including evolutionary computation, and medical multimedia data. These exotic fields use variety of data sources and structures, interrelated by the nature of the phenomenon that these structures describe. As a result there is an increasing interest in new techniques and tools that can detect and discover patterns that can lead to a new knowledge in the problem domain where the data has been collected. There is also an increasing interest in the analysis of multimedia data generated by different distributed applications, like collaborative virtual environments, virtual communities, and multi-agent systems. These heterogeneous multimedia data records require sophisticated preprocessing, synchronization and other transformation procedures before even getting to the analysis stage.On the other hand, researchers in multimedia information systems, in the search for techniques for improving the indexing and retrieval of multimedia information are looking into new methods for discovering indexing information. Variety of techniques from machine learning, statistics, databases, knowledge acquisition, data visualization, image analysis, high performance computing, and knowledge-based systems, have been used mainly as a research handcraft activity. The development of multimedia databases and their query interfaces recall again the idea of incorporating multimedia data mining methods for dynamic indexing. The emerging international standard for multimedia content description (MPEG-7) promises to foster the collaboration in the field giving a uniform data representation.The 6th Workshop on Multimedia Data mining continues the series of successful workshops that have been held in conjunction with KDD Conferences in Boston (2000), San Francisco (2001), Edmonton (2002), Washington (2003) and Seattle (2004). These workshops brought together numerous experts in spatial data analysis, digital media, multimedia information retrieval, stateof- art data mining and knowledge discovery in multimedia database systems, and data analysis in collaborative virtual environments. For more information about the workshops see the reports in &lt;I&gt;SIGKDD Exploration&lt;/I&gt; (2(2), 3 (2) and 4(2)).The topic of the 6th Workshop is &lt;I&gt;Multimedia Mining&lt;/I&gt;. It means that the Workshop focuses on issues related to mining information from multi-modality, multisource, multi-format data in an integrated way. The selected papers represent a wide range of approaches, techniques, and tool that cover different aspects of image, audio and video indexing and annotation, and their integration into intelligent decision making systems. Furthermore, in order to encourage submissions of greenhouse work, which present early stages of cutting-edge research and development, this year a "short papers" session is added to the program of MDM 2005. This session will give to research teams the opportunity to present their research problems. In addition to the program of accepted papers, the workshop will enjoy an invited speaker: Professor Christos Faloutsos, Dept of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, USA.},

To fully unleash the performance potential of such memory systems, this paper presents BonsaiKV, a key-value store that makes the best use of different components in a tiered memory system. The core of BonsaiKV is a tri-layer hierarchical storage architecture that separates data indexing, persistence, and scalability from each other and realizes each of them within a specialized software-hardware layer. We design BonsaiKV with a set of novel techniques, including collaborative tiered indexing, NVMM congestion control mechanisms, fine-grained data striping, and NUMA-aware data management, to leverage hardware strengths and tackle device deficiencies. We compare BonsaiKV with state-of-the-art NVMM-optimized key-value stores and persistent index structures using a variety of YCSB workloads. Evaluation results demonstrate that BonsaiKV outperforms others by up to 7.69\texttimes{}, 19.59\texttimes{}, and 12.86\texttimes{} in read-, write- and scan-intensive scenarios, respectively.},

abstract = {The personal computer as used by most people still to a large degree follows an interaction and technological design dating back to Allan Kay's Dynabook and the Xerox Star. This implies that interaction is confined to a single device with a single keyboard/mouse/display hardware configuration sitting on a desk, and personal rather than collaborative work is in focus.The challenges of "moving the computer beyond the desktop" are being addressed within different research fields. For example, Ubiquitous Computing (Ubicomp) investigates how computing can be embedded in everyday life; Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) researches collaborative interaction; and many researchers in the CHI and EICS community explores basic infrastructure and technologies for handling multiple devices and displays in e.g. smart room setups.In this talk, I will present our approach to these challenges. Specifically, I will introduce the term of "distributed interaction," which is a research agenda focusing on researching theory, conceptual frameworks, interaction design, user interfaces, and infrastructure that allow interaction with computers to be distributed along three dimension: Devices -- computers should not be viewed as single device but as (inter)networked devices. Hence, interaction is not confined to one device, but should encompass multiple devices.Space -- computers are distributed in space and time, and are not confined to one setting. This includes mobility, but more importantly that devices are to be found in all sorts of odd settings where they need to adapt to, and collaborate with, their surroundings, including other devices, people, interaction devices, etc.People -- computers are to a large degree the primary way of collaboration in distributed organizations. Hence, a lot has changed since the personal computer was designed for small office collaboration and there is a need for incorporating support for global interaction as a fundamental mechanism in the computing platforms.I will present our current approach for supporting distributed interaction called "activity-based computing" (ABC). Based on a strong theoretical foothold in Activity Theory, ABC provides a conceptual framework, interaction design, user interface, and a distributed programming and runtime infrastructure for distributed interaction. I will present ABC and show how it has been applied in building support for clinical work in hospitals and for smart space technology.},

Organizational changes occur in phases from the analysis of the current problems to the creation and implementation of solutions. Furthermore, people with different learning styles seem to adapt better to these different phases. The main goal of our project is to develop a system that allows for collaboration through the organizational phases in an adaptive way as a function of the learning style.Research approach -- After a pilot study that establishes the exact connection between learning styles and performance in organizational phases, an initial prototype of the adaptive system is described.Findings/Design -- The main goals of our research project are to explore the relationships between learning styles and organizational changes and to design an adaptive system for learning styles during the different phases of organizational changes.Research limitations/Implications -- Research on this line has been scarce and the need of considering collaboration and communication adds complexity to the task at hand.Originality/Value -- The relevance of this research is theoretical and practical. Theoretically this research will help to understand the connection between the organizational lifecycles and learning styles. In practice, the development of an adaptive system for learning skills and procedures, and not only content, will help organizations in the process of adapting successfully to changes.Take away message -- An adaptive system that motivates employees to learn the proper skills needed and guide them during organizational changes can decrease rejections to change in organizations and increase success.},

abstract = {Collaborative virtual and augmented reality are an active area of research and many systems supporting collaboration have been presented. Just like there are many different systems for VR and AR, there are many different types of collaboration. In some cases, virtual reality is used to enhance an existing collaborative process. In other cases, it enables new types of collaboration that previously were not possible (e.g. distributed VR). Other systems support tasks that can be performed either individually as well as collaboratively. While these tasks may allow to be performed collaboratively, little has been said on what the benefit is in doing so. We present a user study of a collaborative construction task in a shared physical workspace virtual reality environment under various degrees of interaction in collaboration. Our results show that, for this type of task, a pair of subjects concurrently interacting can be significantly more effective, even though individual user performance decreases. Our results further show that there is no significant benefit in giving only verbal and non-verbal assistance over a single user performing the task.},

abstract = {Development of a collaborative distributed supply chain simulation implies interoperation of heterogeneous systems. Interoperability among several independent systems requires mutual understanding and meaning of shared data represented in a common structure. These two requirements are always a real challenge. In a High Level Architecture (HLA) based supply chain simulation, the federation object model (FOM) performs as a contract where mutual understanding and shared information are described. However, this contract is usually established manually and then the consistency and completeness cannot be guaranteed. Developing FOM and modifying existing systems to comply with the FOM implies a significant amount of time and effort which reduce the benefits of system reuse. This paper presents a heavy-weighted ontology-based method to construct interoperation models of HLA based supply chain simulation in a human-friendly, efficient, consistent and complete way. Besides, this method provides support to collaboration among several organizations of a supply chain.},

abstract = {Although there has been a great deal of research into Collaborative Information Retrieval/Seeking (CIR/S), the majority has assumed that team members in a collaborative search team always have the same level of unrestricted access to information. However, observations from different domains such as healthcare, business, government, etc. have suggested that collaboration sometimes involves people with differing levels of access to information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). As well as a support for collaboration, MLCIR must consider information flow, security and shareability between collaborators. Therefore, existing CIR/S interface components and concepts (e.g. awareness, division of labour, persistence, etc.) may not be directly applicable to MLCIR. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any systematic evaluations to investigate the impact of MLCIR on search outcomes and to provide user-centred design recommendations for MLCIR interfaces. To address this gap, a number of studies were conducted using real-world MLCIR examples as scenarios. This thesis highlights four research objectives; these are: 1) to investigate the impact of different collaborative search strategies and MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user simulation approach, 2) to develop a preliminary MLCIR interface and investigate the impact of MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user study, 3) to investigate the impact of existing CIR concepts on MLCIR search outcomes using a user study, and 4) to develop and evaluate a working prototype of an MLCIR interface that supports users for asynchronous collaboration. These investigations followed an iterative approach until a final MLCIR interface could be produced. The first study was a user simulated study which allowed us to test a large number of variables and to pick prominent ones for further user studies. It was found that when relevance feedback search strategies were used, search performance of non-full access (where team members had 90% access to collection) outperformed full access (where team members had 100% access to collection). This simulated study also fulfilled the first research objective. Next, a preliminary user study was conducted using variables selected based on the findings of the simulated study. This study uncovered a number of interface components, and awareness concepts such as query awareness, result awareness and team awareness that could be used to support users in MLCIR scenarios. This user study addressed the second research objective. Based on findings from this user study, two further user studies were conducted where we evaluated a number of interface components implemented to support query awareness, result awareness and team awareness. Results suggested that having access to query properties and result properties in MLCIR scenarios can leverage team members? search performance. These two user studies addressed the third research objective. Finally, a working MLCIR interface was built based on the findings elicited from our previous user studies. The interface was then evaluated using the web and non-uniform information access scenarios. The results showed that blacklisting search terms had a significant negative impact on search outcome than blacklisting documents (f-measure: 0.04 vs 0.197). This study fulfilled the final research objective. All five studies presented in this thesis provided us with an increasing understanding of how to develop an MLCIR interface that is usable and helpful for users. As a final product, a working MLCIR interface was produced which could provide collaborating users with useful awareness information without disclosing any sensitive data. Overall, this thesis provided important new design suggestions and showed reusability of CIR components for MLCIR interfaces, something that has never been demonstrated before. The interfaces, experimental designs and findings including design suggestions that are presented in this thesis serve as novel guidelines for further investigations into MLCIR.},

abstract = {WebSplitter symbolizes the union of pervasive multi-device computing and collaborative multi-user computing.  WebSplitter provides a unified XML framework that enables multi-device and multi-user Web browsing.  WebSplitter splits a requested Web page and delivers the appropriate partial view of each page to each user, or more accurately to each user's set of devices.  Multiple users can participate in the same browsing session, as in traditional conferencing groupware.  Depending on the access privileges of the user to the different components of content on each page, WebSplitter generates a personalized partial view.  WebSplitter further splits the partial view among the devices available to each user,  e.g. laptop, wireless PDA, projection display, stereo speakers, orchestrating a  composite presentation across the devices.  A wireless PDA can browse while remotely controlling the multimedia capabilities of nearby devices.  The architecture consists of an XML metadata policy file defining access privileges to XML tags on a Web page, a middleware proxy that splits XML Web content to create partial views, and a client-side component, e.g. applet, enabling user login and reception of pushed browsing data.  Service discovery finds and registers proxies, browsing sessions, and device capabilities.  We demonstrate the feasibility of splitting the different tags in an XML Web page to different end users browsers, and of pushing updates from the browsing session to heterogeneous devices, including a laptop and a PDA.},

The development of a head-worn camera enables us to capture the first-person view and share it as the personal experience. However, the limited viewing angle of such cameras prevents a remote viewer from obtaining a complete surrounding situation. In this paper, we propose a system called LiveSphere, which presents the entire surrounding visual environment using a head-worn system with multiple cameras. The image-stabilizing algorithm compensates image motion caused by the wearer's head movement. This enables the remote viewer to look around the environment independently from the wearer's head direction. We developed a prototype to examine how sharing the surrounding visual environment improves collaboration between persons in different places.},

It is a unique and comprehensive approach which uses task-specific configurations to support the design workflow from concept to mock-up evaluation and review. The first-phase conceptual design benefits from a workbench-like 3-D display for free hand sketching, surfacing and engineering visualization. Semi-transparentstereo glasses augment the pre-production physical prototype by additional shapes, textures and annotations. Both workspaces share a common interface and allow collaboration and cooperation between different experts, who can configure the system for the specific task. A faster design workflow and CAD data consistency can be thus naturally achieved. Tests andcollaborations with designers, mainly from automotive industry, are providing systematic feedback for this on-going research. As far as the authors are concerned, there is no known similar approach that integrates the creation and editing phase of 3D curves and surfaces in Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR).

However, the physical body is rarely purposefully incorporated throughout such design processes, leaving designers seated behind their desks, relying on their previous know-how and assumptions. In contrast, embodied design techniques from HCI and performing arts afford direct corporeal feedback to verify and adapt experiential aesthetics within the design process. This paper proposes a performative prototyping method, which combines bodystorming methods with Wizard of Oz techniques with a puppeteering approach, using inside-out somaesthetic- and outside-in dramaturgical perspectives. In addition, it suggests an interdisciplinary vocabulary to share and evaluate PMRE experiences during and after its design collaboration. This method is exemplified and investigated by comparing two case studies of PMRE design projects in higher-art education using the existing Social VR platform NEOS VR adapted as a CMRE.},

abstract = {Web-based collaboration systems typically require dynamic and context-based interactions between people and services. To support such complex interaction scenarios, we introduce a mixed service-oriented system that is composed of both humans and software services, collaborating and interacting to perform certain activities. As an example, consider a professional online help and support community spanning interactions between human participants and software-based services. Trust between these members is essential for successful collaborations and has been extensively studied in the context of social and collaborative networks. In this paper, we discuss trust from a collaborative and social point of view instead of a security perspective. Our approach follows an interaction monitoring and an interpretative rule-based trust inference model established on previous behavior.However, trust relations encourage network members to continue interacting with successful (and thus trusted) collaboration partners, and to avoid, or even refuse, interactions with unknown actors. This behavior has negative side-effects from a global community perspective. Given the help and support environment, a small number of popular network members will become increasingly overloaded with support requests. We solve this load and interaction balancing problem by the means of trustworthy request delegations.},

Our evaluation proved that more patient information can efficiently be displayed to all meeting participants, compared to the current situation.

We foresee a great opportunity to improve medical work, by introducing collaborative tools and visualisation of medical data, but it requires that interaction design becomes a natural part of medical work.},

abstract = {The utilization of digital knowledge management systems (KMS) to improve learning is a conventional trend in modern day computer science. These systems facilitate knowledge creation, sharing, and implementation of various pedagogical approaches including collaboration tasks. In situations where traditional learning scenarios are not possible, collaborative tools and platforms are used for providing immersive learning experiences. As it is known, collaboration has become a core competency of modern education, and an indispensable tool employed in the information technology sector. There exist different forms of knowledge management systems with different architecture. This leads to one system facilitating one form of pedagogy over the other. On the one hand, collaborative pedagogical approaches in digital learning can aid knowledge sharing, question asking, with which a feedback is expected without time and space constraints. Certain mechanisms in some KMS architectures such as Topic Maps emphasizes on the findalibility of information, which in turn could promote collaborative pedagogy. This paper discusses the development of a collaborative knowledge blog with some topic map implementation. It investigates the role of digital collaborative learning in scientific knowledge acquisition. We assessed students’ ease of learning and analyzed their engagement while utilizing the system. Results indicate that the students showed deeper engagement and improved in their scientific understanding over time which reinforces the importance of collaborative activities as observed in literature.},

abstract = {With the increasing demand for Web of Things (WoT) and edge computing, the efficient utilization of limited computing power on edge devices is becoming a crucial challenge. Traditional neural networks (NNs) as web services rely on deterministic computational resources. However, they may fail to output the results on non-deterministic computing power which could be preempted at any time, degrading the task performance significantly. Multi-exit NNs with multiple branches have been proposed as a solution, but the accuracy of intermediate results may be unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose MEEdge, a system that automatically transforms classic single-exit models into heterogeneous and dynamic multi-exit models which enables Memory-Elastic inference at the Edge with non-deterministic computing power. To build heterogeneous multi-exit models, MEEdge uses efficient convolutions to form a branch zoo and High Priority First (HPF)-based branch placement method for branch growth. To adapt models to dynamically varying computational resources, we employ a novel on-device scheduler for collaboration. Further, to reduce the memory overhead caused by dynamic branches, we propose neuron-level weight sharing and few-shot knowledge distillation(KD) retraining. Our experimental results show that models generated by MEEdge can achieve up to 27.31% better performance than existing multi-exit NNs.},

abstract = {In the new space economy, space agencies, large enterprises, and start-ups aim to launch space multi-robot systems (MRS) for various in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) purposes, such as mapping, soil evaluation, and utility provisioning. However, these stakeholders' competing economic interests may hinder effective collaboration on a centralized digital platform. To address this issue, neutral and transparent infrastructures could facilitate coordination and value exchange among heterogeneous space MRS. While related work has expressed legitimate concerns about the technical challenges associated with blockchain use in space, we argue that weighing its potential economic benefits against its drawbacks is necessary. This paper presents a novel architectural framework and a comprehensive set of requirements for integrating blockchain technology in MRS, aiming to enhance coordination and data integrity in space exploration missions. We explored distributed ledger technology (DLT) to design a non-proprietary architecture for heterogeneous MRS and validated the prototype in a simulated lunar environment. The analyses of our implementation suggest global ISRU efficiency improvements for map exploration, compared to a corresponding group of individually acting robots, and that fostering a coopetitive environment may provide additional revenue opportunities for stakeholders.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the computing resources available in the cloud are often unable to meet the latency constraints of time critical applications due to the large distance between the cloud and data sources (IoT devices). The adoption of edge computing can help the cloud deliver services that meet time critical application requirements. However, it is challenging to meet the IoT application demands while using the resources smartly to reduce energy consumption at the edge of the network. In this context, we propose a fully distributed resource allocation algorithm for the IoT-edge-cloud environment, which (i) increases the infrastructure resource usage by promoting the collaboration between edge nodes, (ii) supports the heterogeneity and generic requirements of applications, and (iii) reduces the application latency and increases the energy efficiency of the edge. We compare our algorithm with a non-collaborative vertical offloading and with a horizontal approach based on edge collaboration. Results of simulations showed that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce 49.95% of the IoT application request end-to-end latency, increase 95.35% of the edge node utilization, and enhance the energy efficiency in terms of the edge node power consumption by 92.63% in comparison to the best performances of vertical and collaboration approaches.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems form collaborative networks dynamically at runtime. In the collaboration of multiple systems, behavior emerges in the interplay of the collaborating instances. This emergent behavior raises challenges for the validation of cyber-physical systems' software, since interoperability of the single systems as well as functional correctness of the entire network of collaborative cyber-physical systems must be validated for all possible configurations of the network. Such network configurations differ, among others, in the number of participating systems, the number of system types involved, and the communication patterns between the participating systems. To aid the validation of behavior emerging from the collaboration, this paper proposes the automated generation of dedicated review diagrams to investigate the collaborative network's behavior for different network configurations. First evaluations using case examples from industry partners show that the use of such automatically generated instance level review diagrams can support the validation of collaborative cyber-physical systems.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures are emerging as a fundamental computing platform across a variety of domains, from mobile to cloud computing. Heterogeneity, however, increases design complexity in terms of hardware-software interactions, access to shared resources, and diminished regularity of the design. Embedded Scalable Platforms are a novel approach to SoC design and programming that addresses these design-complexity challenges by combining an architecture and a methodology. The flexible socketed architecture simplifies the integration of heterogeneous components by balancing regularity and specialization. The companion methodology raises the level of abstraction to system-level design, thus promoting closer collaboration among software programmers and hardware engineers. The architecture is supported by a scalable communication infrastructure. The methodology leverages compositional design-space exploration with high-level synthesis. The case for Embedded Scalable Platforms is made based on experiments on the development of various full-system prototypes and experience in teaching these concepts in a new graduate course.},

abstract = {Most of the previous approaches surrounding collaborative information retrieval (CIR) provide either a user-based mediation, in which the system only supports users' collaborative activities, or a system-based mediation, in which the system plays an active part in balancing user roles, re-ranking results, and distributing them to optimize overall retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to combine both of these approaches by a role mining methodology that learns from users' actions about the retrieval strategy they adapt. This hybrid method aims at showing how users are different and how to use these differences for suggesting roles. The core of the method is expressed as an algorithm that (1) monitors users' actions in a CIR setting; (2) discovers differences among the collaborators along certain dimensions; and (3) suggests appropriate roles to make the most out of individual skills and optimize IR performance. Our approach is empirically evaluated and relies on two different laboratory studies involving 70 pairs of users. Our experiments show promising results that highlight how role mining could optimize the collaboration within a search session. The contributions of this work include a new algorithm for mining user roles in collaborative IR, an evaluation methodology, and a new approach to improve IR performance with the operationalization of user-driven system-mediated collaboration.},

We carried out design workshops with emergent users, revealing opportunities for novel collocated collaborative interactions. In this paper we present Better Together - a framework for disaggregating services, splitting interaction elements over separate mobiles. This distribution supports both sharing of resources (such as screen real-estate, or mobile data); and, scaffolding of inclusive interaction in mixed groups (e.g., in terms of literacy or prior technology exposure). We developed two prototypes to explore the concept, trialling the first---collocated group-based shopping list making---with emergent users in South Africa and India. We deployed the second probe, which splits YouTube into its constituent parts across separate mobiles, in a longitudinal study with users in Kenya, South Africa and India. We describe the concept and design process, and report on the design's suitability for emergent users based on our results.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers attempt to utilize online social information to alleviate data sparsity for collaborative filtering, based on the rationale that social networks offers the insights to understand the behavioral patterns. However, due to the overlook of inter-dependent knowledge across items (e.g., knowledge graph dependencies between products), existing social recommender systems are insufficient to distill the heterogeneous collaborative signals from both user and item side. In this work, we propose Self- Supervised Metagraph Informax Network (SMIN) which investigates the potential of jointly incorporating social- and knowledge-aware relational structures into the user preference representation framework. To model relation heterogeneity, we design a metapath-guided heterogeneous graph neural network to aggregate feature embeddings from different types of meta-relations across users and items, empowering SMIN to maintain dedicated representations for multifaceted user- and item-wise dependencies. Additionally, to inject high-order collaborative signals into recommendation, we generalize the mutual information learning paradigm from vector space to a self-supervised graph-based collaborative filtering. This endows the expressive modeling of user-item interactive patterns, by exploring global-level collaborative relations and underlying isomorphic transformation property of graph topology. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further analysis provides insights into the performance superiority of our new recommendation framework. We release our source code at https://github.com/SocialRecsys/SMIN.},

However, many ACLS systems are ill-suited for rural contexts where students often need multiple kinds of support to complete tasks, may speak languages unsupported by the system, and require more than pre-assigned tutor-tutee student pairs for more equitable learning. We designed an intervention that fosters more equitable help-seeking by automatically detecting student struggles and prompts them to seek help from specific peers that can help. We conducted a mixed-methods experimental study with 98 K-3 students in a rural village in Tanzania over a one-month period, evaluating how the system affects student interactions, system engagement, and student learning. Our intervention increased student interactions by almost 4 times compared to the control condition, increased domain knowledge interactions, and propelled students to engage in more cognitively challenging activities.},

Sustainability aspects like energy and resource efficiency, possible reduction of the ecological footprint, and sustainable solutions for lasting and vision-based use in companies are considered. Within several use cases with 20 industry partners in the following areas are developed: 1) novel forms of space-independent collaboration (e.g., collaborative work by integrating real-time 3D depth information of the real environment and visualization of and interaction with real-time production data) and 2) XR-supported training and learning methods (e.g., parameterizable and adaptive training scenarios, roll-out of training content for several participants and integration of gamification mechanisms). Additionally, the methodology for a sustainability assessment, technology acceptance, and a multi-criteria evaluation are shown, and first results are discussed.},

Research shows that such individuals seek to customize different aspects of their interactions with these devices, including how they engage with, decorate, and wear them. However, it remains challenging to tailor both device form and function to accommodate individual needs. To address this challenge, we introduce GlucoMaker, a system for collaboratively customizing physical design aspects of glucose monitors. Prior to designing GlucoMaker, we conducted a prototyping and focus group study to understand customization preferences and collaboration benefits. GlucoMaker provides individuals with the ability to a) select monitor form and function preferences, b) alter predefined and downloadable digital model files, c) receive feedback on monitor designs from stakeholders, and d) learn technical design aspects. We further demonstrate the versatility and design space of GlucoMaker with three examples of different form and function use cases.},

abstract = {Technology advances in areas such as sensors, IoT, and robotics, enable new collaborative applications (e.g., autonomous devices). A primary requirement for such collaborations is to have a secure system that enables information sharing and information flow protection. A policy-based management system is a key mechanism for secure selective sharing of protected resources. However, policies in each party of a collaborative environment cannot be static as they have to adapt to different contexts and situations. One advantage of collaborative applications is that each party in the collaboration can take advantage of the knowledge of the other parties for learning or enhancing its own policies. We refer to this learning mechanism as policy transfer. The design of a policy transfer framework has challenges, including policy conflicts and privacy issues. Policy conflicts typically arise because of differences in the obligations of the parties, whereas privacy issues result because of data sharing constraints for sensitive data. Hence, the policy transfer framework should be able to tackle such challenges by considering minimal sharing of data and supporting policy adaptation to address conflict. In the paper, we propose a framework that aims at addressing such challenges. We introduce a formal definition of the policy transfer problem for attribute-based access control policies. We then introduce the transfer methodology which consists of three sequential steps. Finally, we report experimental results.},

However, the low-quality of data in many IoT platforms, especially those composed of heterogeneous devices, is hindering the development of high-quality applications for those platforms. The solution presented in this article is intelligent data collaboration, i.e., the concept of deep learning providing IoT with the ability to adaptively collaborate to accomplish a task. Here, we outline the concept of intelligent data collaboration in detail and present a mathematical model in general form. To demonstrate one possible case where intelligent data collaboration would be useful, we prepared an implementation called adaptive data cleaning (ADC), designed to filter noisy data out of temperature readings in an IoT base station network. ADC primarily consists of a denoising autoencoder LSTM for predictions and a four-level data processing mechanism to perform the filtering. Comparisons between ADC and a maximum slop method show ADC with the lowest false error and the best filtering rates.},

These include collaborative and multimodal military command posts, the latter of which is one of our application domains. Nevertheless few collaborative and multimodal interface specification notations are proposed. As a first step towards a notation for specifying a design solution prior to its software design and development, we adopt an empirical approach. In this paper we apply and compare four existing notations for collaborative systems by considering a case study, namely, a system for supporting informal co-located collaboration in hospital work. Since the selected notations differ in their descriptive qualities, with some focusing on collaborative tasks while others focus on the users' roles and on collaborative situations, our goal is not to empirically evaluate the notations. Our goal is rather to assess their complementary aspects and their projected ability to specify a multimodal collaborative user interface.},

Previous work has shown that tablet-only collaboration can be improved by an additional shared workspace on an interactive tabletop. However, large tabletops are costly and need space, raising the question to what extent the physical size of shared horizontal surfaces really pays off. In order to analyse the suitability of smaller-than-tabletop devices (e.g. tablets) as a low-cost alternative, we studied the effect of the size of a shared horizontal interactive workspace on users' attention, awareness, and efficiency during cross-device collaboration. In our study, 15 groups of two users executed a sensemaking task with two personal tablets (9.7") and a horizontal shared display of varying sizes (10.6", 27", and 55"). Our findings show that different sizes lead to differences in participants' interaction with the tabletop and in the groups' communication styles. To our own surprise we found that larger tabletops do not necessarily improve collaboration or sensemaking results, because they can divert users' attention away from their collaborators and towards the shared display.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) is an evolving sector within learning analytics that has become increasingly useful for examining complex learning and collaboration dynamics for group work across all educational levels. The availability of low-cost sensors and affordable computational power allows researchers to investigate different modes of group work. However, the field faces challenges stemming from the complexity and specialization of the systems required for capturing diverse interaction modalities, with commercial systems often being expensive or narrow in scope and researcher-developed systems needing to be more specialized and difficult to deploy. Therefore, more user-friendly, adaptable, affordable, open-source, and easy-to-deploy systems are needed to advance research and application in the MMLA field. The paper presents a field report on the design of mBox that aims to support group work across different contexts. We share the progress of mBox, a low-cost, easy-to-use platform grounded on learning theories to investigate collaborative learning settings. Our approach has been guided by iterative design processes that let us rapidly prototype different solutions for these settings.},

The supported languages include Scala, Python, SQL, and Shell script as well as big data processing back ends including Hadoop, Spark and Hive. With the necessary tool sets, an interactive and dynamic data analysis can be done on the fly with heterogeneous programming interfaces. Although Zeppelin is great for code development and interactive analysis with small scale data set for proof-of-concept or use-case presentations, running the data processing pipeline in the batch mode is still needed for performance, robustness to fit in an automated workflow in some cases. We are developing a tool to convert Zeppelin notebook into a workflow with a set of codes that can run in a batch mode through command line interface without requiring running Zeppelin, so that the prototype code can be seamlessly deployed on the production cluster after demo stage. The entire workflow can be preserved, configured manually and run automatically. Zeppelin also provides a flexible way to integrate the visualization functionality, another contribution of this paper is to extend the Zeppelin's existing built-in visualization component for D3Network. With two added features described above, Zeppelin can help users to develop big data pipeline and visualizing graph data quickly and efficiently.},

Collaborative security is an abstract concept that applies to a wide variety of systems and has been used to solve security issues inherent in distributed environments.

In this survey, we focus on different mechanisms of collaboration and defense in collaborative security. We systematically investigate numerous use cases of collaborative security by covering six types of security systems. Aspects of these systems are thoroughly studied, including their technologies, standards, frameworks, strengths and weaknesses. We then present a comprehensive study with respect to their analysis target, timeliness of analysis, architecture, network infrastructure, initiative, shared information and interoperability. We highlight five important topics in collaborative security, and identify challenges and possible directions for future research. Our work contributes the following to the existing research on collaborative security with the goal of helping to make collaborative security systems more resilient and efficient. This study (1) clarifies the scope of collaborative security, (2) identifies the essential components of collaborative security, (3) analyzes the multiple mechanisms of collaborative security, and (4) identifies challenges in the design of collaborative security.},

abstract = {My dissertation is aimed at enabling people to collaborate to create complex artifacts: for example, to develop software, sketch GUI prototypes, play music together, or write a novel. Such creative processes are not well defined and can evolve dynamically. We introduce interactive systems that help users collaborate and communicate in the open-ended process. In particular, we investigate the benefits of both integrating asynchronous interactions into real-time collaborations and of having real time components in asynchronous collaborative settings. The systems provide tools that combine the two different types of interaction techniques, and we validate them via user study, participatory performing arts, and the online deployments of systems and crowdsourced tasks. The hybrid methods are designed to help users recover collaborative context, make the process approachable to nonexperts, collaborate online crowds on demand in real-time, and sustain liveness during collaboration. The dissertation will result in cross-domain knowledge in designing collaborative systems and it will help us create a framework for future intelligent systems that will help people solve more complex tasks effectively.},

abstract = {Two main challenges in recommender systems are modeling users with heterogeneous taste, and providing explainable recommendations. In this paper, we propose the neural Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (AMP-CF) model as a unified solution for both problems. AMP-CF breaks down the user to several latent ‘personas’ (profiles) that identify and discern the different tastes and inclinations of the user. Then, the revealed personas are used to generate and explain the final recommendation list for the user. AMP-CF models users as an attentive mixture of personas, enabling a dynamic user representation that changes based on the item under consideration. We demonstrate AMP-CF on five collaborative filtering datasets from the domains of movies, music, video games and social networks. As an additional contribution, we propose a novel evaluation scheme for comparing the different items in a recommendation list based on the distance from the underlying distribution of “tastes” in the user’s historical items. Experimental results show that AMP-CF is competitive with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, we provide qualitative results to showcase the ability of AMP-CF to explain its recommendations.},

Here we present two instances of co-design of museum visiting aids, one stemming from an open brief, another from an initial working prototype; we discuss the process in each case and discuss how these alternative strategies presented the team with different possibilities as well as constraints, and led to different patterns of collaboration within the design team.

Due to the inconsistency in design and development standards of devices from different manufacturers, it is difficult for devices to interact with each other in traditional IoT solutions. Inspired by the idea of collaborative communication, here we propose a new framework of Nodes' Smart Connection Oriented to Collaborative IoT (C-IoT) called NSIIC (Nodes' Sense, Identification and Inter-Collaboration, NSIIC). In this framework, the data and communication management processes are transferred from the application layer to the bottom of protocol (stack) layer inside each terminal. A unified application data encapsulation format and an efficient inter-node communication collaboration strategy are designed, in order to avoid competition between different communication tasks and improve the utilization efficiency of bandwidth. Along with this framework, a strategy about data and communication management is proposed. Finally, we talk about the necessity, effectiveness and problem of the framework.},

This heterogeneous distribution of resources and the various modes of collaborations that exist between users, virtual organizations, and resource providers require scalable, flexible, and fine-grained access control to pro-tect both individual and shared computing resources. In this paper we propose a usage control (UCON) based authorization frame-work for collaborative applications. In our framework, usage con-trol policies are defined using subject and object attributes, along with system attributes as conditions. General attributes include not only persistent attributes such as role and group memberships, but also mutable usage attributes of subjects and objects. Conditions in UCON can be used to support context-based authorizations in ad-hoc collaborations. As a proof-of-concept we implement a pro-totype system based on our proposed architecture and conduct ex-perimental studies to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach.},

abstract = {Within the current economic context, enterprises are facing new interoperability issues due to increasing needs of eBusiness Collaboration within the emerging digital ecosystems they belong to. They also need to be able to keep in pace with their heterogeneous internal legacy systems. In addition, they should not have to modify their infrastructure or applications for fast and short collaboration implying information and knowledge interchange with new partners of their ecosystem. Current solutions are less and less adapted to face increasing needs and complexity. As proposing a new disruptive approach and technologies is inappropriate, this paper presents how to build enterprise application interoperability framework based on simultaneous and coherent usage of eBusiness standards used by a given ecosystem, combining usage of the different relevant frameworks supporting these standards. The goal is achievement of "pragmatic" interoperability. For the proposed approach, we consider simultaneous usage of Model Driven Engineering, Enterprise Modeling and Service Oriented Architecture. We also promote systematic usage of commodities on the WEB based on open and governed standards. Doing so, we have to solve issues related to semantic preservation, all along the lifecycle of the artifacts and infrastructures required to define and exploit an application. We introduce for that the concept of Extended Hypermodels and associated grounds.},

abstract = {The cold start problem in recommender systems is a long-standing challenge, which requires recommending to new users (items) based on attributes without any historical interaction records. In these recommendation systems, warm users (items) have privileged collaborative signals of interaction records compared to cold start users (items), and these Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals are shown to have competing performance for recommendation. Many researchers proposed to learn the correlation between collaborative signal embedding space and the attribute embedding space to improve the cold start recommendation, in which user and item categorical attributes are available in many online platforms. However, the cold start recommendation is still limited by two embedding spaces modeling and simple assumptions of space transformation. As user-item interaction behaviors and user (item) attributes naturally form a heterogeneous graph structure, in this paper, we propose a privileged graph distillation model (PGD). The teacher model is composed of a heterogeneous graph structure for warm users and items with privileged CF links. The student model is composed of an entity-attribute graph without CF links. Specifically, the teacher model can learn better embeddings of each entity by injecting complex higher-order relationships from the constructed heterogeneous graph. The student model can learn the distilled output with privileged CF embeddings from the teacher embeddings. Our proposed model is generally applicable to different cold start scenarios with new user, new item, or new user-new item. Finally, extensive experimental results on the real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on different types of cold start problems, with average 6.6%, 5.6%, and 17.1% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on three datasets, respectively.},

abstract = {Current modeling packages have polished interfaces for editing polygonal meshes, where artists work individually on each mesh. A variety of recent cloud-based services have shown the benefits of editing documents in real-time collaboration with others. In this paper, we present a system for collaborative editing of low-polygonal and subdivision mesh models. We cast collaborative editing as a special instance of distributed version control. We support concurrent editing by robustly sharing and merging mesh version histories in real-time. We store and transmit mesh differences efficiently by encoding them as sequences of primitive editing operations. We enable collaboration by merging and detecting conflicts. We extend this model letting artists adapt others' editing histories by retargeting sequences of editing operations to new parts of the mesh with potentially different topology. We tested our algorithms by editing meshes with up to thousand edits, in collaborative editing sessions lasting a few hours, and by retargeting sequences of several hundred edits. We found the proposed system to be reliable, fast and scaling well with mesh complexity. We demonstrate that our merge algorithm is more robust than prior work. We further validated the proposed collaborative workflow with a user study where MeshHisto was consistently preferred over other alternatives for collaborative workflows.},

A model-driven development process enables such prototypes to be tightly coupled with design choices established in earlier design phases. It also supports an incremental evolution into the final, not simulated, MIS. The prototyping approach that we present is based on the identification of the roles of the different actors involved in a MIS development process and the collaboration between them.

abstract = {Social IoT (or SIoT) is an alternate architectural pattern for IoT, which involves imparting social behavioral attributes to IoT devices. An SIoT service network uses social collaboration between IoT devices (acting as service users or service providers or both), enabling low-latency collaborative services and applications. A key challenge in implementing an SIoT service network in a multi-vendor network of heterogeneous IoT devices is the issue of Trust. The problem is in prioritization and selection of trustworthy service provider(s) in an autonomous and independent manner. In a single-vendor network, the problem is handled via proprietary methods that do not scale for multi-vendor environments. The problem is further compounded in networks having IoT devices that are constrained in computational and storage resources. In this paper, we propose the use of Neighborhood Overlap for estimating tie-strengths and the consequent prioritization of service providers based on the estimated tie-strength. We verify the relationship between neighborhood overlap and tie-strength using three publicly available datasets. While past research on neighborhood-overlap and its relationship with tie-strength focuses on undirected social networks only, we extend the definition of neighborhood-overlap for directed networks. We further prove this extension with the help of two publicly available directed social network datasets. The idea proposed in this paper is fundamental and can be extended towards defining a trust framework for SIoT.},

abstract = {Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP show great potential in learning representations that capture latent characteristics of users. A recently proposed method called Contextual Optimization (CoOp) introduces the concept of training prompt for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Given the lightweight nature of this method, researchers have migrated the paradigm from centralized to decentralized system to innovate the collaborative training framework of Federated Learning (FL). However, current prompt training in FL mainly focuses on modeling user consensus and lacks the adaptation to user characteristics, leaving the personalization of prompt largely under-explored. Researches over the past few years have applied personalized FL (pFL) approaches to customizing models for heterogeneous users. Unfortunately, we find that with the variation of modality and training behavior, directly applying the pFL methods to prompt training leads to insufficient personalization and performance. To bridge the gap, we present pFedPrompt, which leverages the unique advantage of multimodality in vision-language models by learning user consensus from linguistic space and adapting to user characteristics in visual space in a non-parametric manner. Through this dual collaboration, the learned prompt will be fully personalized and aligned to the user’s local characteristics. We conduct extensive experiments across various datasets under the FL setting with statistical heterogeneity. The results demonstrate the superiority of our pFedPrompt against the alternative approaches with robust performance.},

While the past decade has seen considerable innovation in systems that track and manage group tasks, these innovations have typically been outside of the principal communication channels: email, instant messenger, and group chat. Teams formulate, discuss, refine, assign, and track the progress of their collaborative tasks over electronic communication channels, yet they must leave these channels to update their task-tracking tools, creating a source of friction and inefficiency. To address this problem, we explore how bots might be used to mediate task management for individuals and teams. We deploy a prototype bot to eight different teams of information workers to help them create, assign, and keep track of tasks, all within their main communication channel. We derived seven insights for the design of future bots for coordinating work.},

abstract = {Mobile health monitoring plays a central role in a variety of health-care applications. Using mobile technology, health-care providers can access clinical information and communicate with subjects in real-time. Due to the sensitive nature of health-care applications, these systems need to process physiological signals highly accurately. However, as mobile devices are employed in dynamic environments, the accuracy of a machine learning model drops whenever a change in configuration of the system occurs. Therefore, data mining and machine learning techniques that specifically address challenges associated with dynamic environments (e.g. different users, signal heterogeneity) are needed. In this paper, using active learning as an organizing principle, we propose a cost-optimal multiple-expert architecture to adapt a machine learning model (e.g. classifier) developed in a given context to a new context or configuration. More specifically, in our architecture, a system's machine learning model learns from experts available to the system (e.g. another mobile device, human annotator) while minimizing the cost of data labeling. Our architecture also exploits collaboration between experts to enrich their knowledge which in turn decreases both cost and uncertainty of data labeling in future steps. We demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture using a publicly available dataset on human activity. We show that the accuracy of activity recognition reaches over 85% by labeling only 15% of unlabeled data. At the same time, the number of queries from human expert is reduced by up to 82%.},

Yet, it is rarely articulated in the design rationales of AR systems that they promote a certain socio-spatial configuration of the users. Learning from proxemics, we argue that such configurations enable and constrain different co-located spatial behaviors with consequences for collaborative activities. We focus specifically on enabling different collaboration styles via the design of Handheld Collaborative Augmented Reality (HCAR) systems. Drawing upon notions of proxemics, we show how different HCAR designs enable different socio-spatial configurations. Through a design exploration, we demonstrate interaction techniques to expand on the notion of collaborative coupling styles by either deliberately designing for aligning with physical reality or going beyond. The main contributions are a proxemics-based conceptual lens and vocabulary for supporting interaction designers in being mindful of the proxemic consequences when developing handheld multi-user AR systems.},

abstract = {Effective communication in project teams is important, but not often taught. We explore how feedback might improve teamwork in a controlled experiment where groups interact through chat rooms. Collaborators who receive high feedback ratings use different language than poor collaborators (e.g. more words, fewer assents, and less affect-laden language). Further, feedback affects language use. This suggests that a system could use linguistic analysis to automatically provide and visualize feedback to teach teamwork. To this end, we present GroupMeter, a system that applies principles discovered in the experiment to provide feedback both from peers and from automated linguistic analysis.},

abstract = {In a container transport system, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used for monitoring products while they are being transported. To be commercially interesting, these WSNs must be integrated with enterprise systems of various actors in the supply chain. The need for interoperability between networks and partners, the heterogeneity of WSN technologies being used, and the mobility of sensor nodes make this integration far from trivial. This paper presents lessons learned from a research project in collaboration with industry in which we developed a prototype middleware solution for container transport. The prototype triggered valuable feedback which is highly relevant to consider when designing middleware for realistic sensor applications.},

The software workflow is optimized according to the requirements of manufacturing industry, and the interaction between front-end collaborative design interface and the back-end management information system is carried out. The collaborative design platform can provide functional support for collaborative design of 2D CAM software in laser processing industry, meet the demands of real-time collaborative design of multi-users in different places, improve the work efficiency and reduce the workload of enterprise designers.},

abstract = {Benchmarking is integral to procurement of HPC systems, communicating HPC center workloads to HPC vendors, and verifying performance of the delivered HPC systems. Currently, HPC benchmarking is manual and challenging at every step, posing a high barrier to entry, and hampering reproducibility of the benchmarks across different HPC systems. In this paper, we propose collaborative continuous benchmarking to enable functional reproducibility, automation, and community collaboration in HPC benchmarking. Recent progress in HPC automation allows us to consider previously unimaginable large-scale improvements to the HPC ecosystem. We define the minimal requirements for collaborative continuous benchmarking and develop a common language to streamline the interactions between HPC centers, vendors, and researchers. We demonstrate the initial implementation of collaborative continuous benchmarking, and introduce an open source continuous benchmarking repository, Benchpark, for community collaboration. We believe collaborative continuous benchmarking will help overcome the human bottleneck in HPC benchmarking, enabling better evaluation of our systems and enabling a more productive collaboration within the HPC community.},

abstract = {The rising cost of healthcare is one of the major concerns faced by the nation. One way to lower healthcare costs and provide better quality care to patients is through the effective use of Information Technology (IT). Data sharing and collaboration and large-scale management of healthcare data have been identified as important IT challenges to advance the nation's healthcare system. In this paper, we present an overview of the software framework called CDN (Collaborative Data Network) that we are developing for large-scale sharing of electronic health records (EHR). In this on-going effort, we focus on sharing EHRs of cancer patients. Cancer is the second leading cause of deaths in the US. CDN is based on the synergistic combination of peer-to-peer technology and the extensible markup language XML and XQuery. We outline the key challenges that arise when sharing evolving, heterogeneous repositories and processing queries across multiple repositories. We present the novel architecture of CDN to overcome these challenges and discuss our plan for implementation, evaluation, and deployment.},

Based on the differences of learners and the implementation of personalized teaching, the functional architecture design of the "man-machine collaboration precision tutoring system" is proposed. The system architecture is divided into three layers: data resource layer, decision processing layer and interactive promotion layer. The data resource layer provides data recording and resource support, the decision processing layer plays the role of data diagnosis and learning analysis, and the interaction promotion layer realizes flexible interaction and grouping. Through collaboration and hierarchical interaction with teachers, a more idealized system can be constructed, which can integrate evidence analysis, timely feedback and personalized support. The value orientation of the system architecture is: teachers and students and intelligent systems expand time and space in collaborative activities, teachers and intelligent systems improve teaching in collaborative optimization, and students and intelligent systems enhance themselves in collaborative interaction.},

abstract = {The scope of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has stretched beyond manufacturing to include energy, healthcare, transportation, and all that tomorrow’s smart cities will entail. The realm of IIoT includes smart sensors, actuators, programmable logic controllers, distributed control systems (DCS), embedded devices, supervisory control, and data acquisition systems—all produced by manufacturers for different purposes and with different data structures and formats; designed according to different standards and made to follow different protocols. In this sea of incompatibility, how can we flexibly acquire these heterogeneous data, and how can we uniformly structure them to suit thousands of different applications? In this article, we survey the four pillars of information science that enable collaborative data access in an IIoT—standardization, data acquisition, data fusion, and scalable architecture—to provide an up-to-date audit of current research in the field. Here, standardization in IIoT relies on standards and technologies to make things communicative; data acquisition attempts to transparently collect data through plug-and-play architectures, reconfigurable schemes, or hardware expansion; data fusion refers to the techniques and strategies for overcoming heterogeneity in data formats and sources; and scalable architecture provides basic techniques to support heterogeneous requirements. The article also concludes with an overview of the frontier researches and emerging technologies for supporting or challenging data access from the aspects of 5G, machine learning, blockchain, and semantic web.},

abstract = {Tool support in chemical process modeling evolved towards using more complex and more integrated systems, often made by combining smaller sub-systems, coming from different vendors. The increasingly growing heterogeneity of these systems led to the emergence of interoperability standards such as CAPE-OPEN. However, the component-based architecture imposed by this standard made the development and maintenance of process modelling components more complex. Indeed, it requires accurate knowledge about three interconnected domains: the process itself, the standard specification, and the middleware (e.g. COM or .NET). Consequently, both development and maintenance tasks require the collaboration of several experts throughout the entire component lifecycle. Tools that assist experts in performing these tasks are thus required. This paper presents an iterative model-driven approach that allows expressing changes through three separated views, each of which is associated to an expert domain, and automatically propagating the effects of these changes in order to generate compliant code. The approach is based on domain-specific modeling and model transformations, and is illustrated through a prototype that has been validated with respect to expected changes impacting the three domains.},

Device data need to be integrated into business processes in a standardized and flexible way. Current research is limited due to a late indication of changes in the production environments, a delay of the implementation of changed production plans, and changes in technology. In this study, design issues arising from features of Internet-based monitoring and control applications have been addressed and an approach based on the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the OPC (Openness, Productivity, and Collaboration; formerly "OLE for Process Control") technology for such applications is proposed by integrating the enterprise systems with shop floor activities. Remote operators use the proposed system that collects all data from distributed control systems (DCSs) or programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to control complex manufacturing processes. Complex processes, i.e., process control and monitoring functions, will be spanned from devices on the shop floors to enterprise systems. Security of remote invocations in the heterogeneous environments is also ensured. The simulation results indicate the proposed system has good performance and is acceptable to Internet-based monitoring and control applications.},

The associated challenges include ambiguity of browses, scarcity of purchases, and heterogeneity arising from different feedback. In this article, we propose to model purchases and browses from a new perspective, i.e., users’ roles of mixer, browser and purchaser. Specifically, we design a novel transfer learning solution termed role-based transfer to rank (RoToR), which contains two variants, i.e., integrative RoToR and sequential RoToR. In integrative RoToR, we leverage browses into the preference learning task of purchases, in which we take each user as a sophisticated customer (i.e., mixer) that is able to take different types of feedback into consideration. In sequential RoToR, we aim to simplify the integrative one by decomposing it into two dependent phases according to a typical shopping process. Furthermore, we instantiate both variants using different preference learning paradigms such as pointwise preference learning and pairwise preference learning. Finally, we conduct extensive empirical studies with various baseline methods on three large public datasets and find that our RoToR can perform significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) devices continuously scan their environment in order to naturally overlay virtual objects onto user's view of the physical world. In contrast to Virtual Reality, where one's environment is fully replaced with a virtual one, one of AR's "killer features" is co-located collaboration, in which multiple users interact with the same combination of virtual and real objects. Microsoft recently released HoloLens, the first consumer-ready augmented reality headset that needs no outside markers to achieve precise inside-out spatial mapping, which allows centimeter-scale hologram positioning.However, despite many applications published on the Windows Mixed Reality platform that rely on direct communication between AR devices, there currently exists no implementation or achievable proposal for secure direct pairing of two unassociated headsets. As augmented reality gets into mainstream, this omission exposes current and future users to a range of avoidable attacks. In order to close this real-world gap in both theory and engineering practice, in this paper we design and evaluate HoloPair, a system for secure and usable pairing of two AR headsets.We propose a pairing protocol and build a working prototype to experimentally evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and system performance. By running a user study with a total of 22 participants, we show that the system achieves high rates of attack detection, short pairing times, and a high average usability score. Moreover, in order to make an immediate impact on the wider developer community, we have published the full implementation and source code of our prototype, which is currently under consideration to be included in the official HoloLens development toolkit.},

Therefore, building upon a cohesion-based model of the discourse, we have validated ReaderBench, a system capable of evaluating collaboration based on a social knowledge-building perspective. Through the inter-twining of different participants' points of view, collaboration emerges and this process is reflected in the identified cohesive links between different speakers. Overall, the current experiments indicate that textual cohesion successfully detects collaboration between participants as ideas are shared and exchanged within an ongoing conversation.},

abstract = {In collocated collaborative creativity work, such as mind mapping or other brainstorming sessions, a group of persons has to solve different tasks as well as discuss and decide on one of the various proposed solutions at the same place. Since mobile devices are increasingly used in collaborative work, these tasks also can be performed digitally. This work addresses the process of voting for one solution out of several proposals. We provide intuitive multi-device interactions for a seamless ranking and voting using multiple mobile devices. They each represent one solution to a given task. Our proposed voting interactions include turning devices and rearranging their order according to their ratings. We demonstrate the feasibility of our interactions by implementing an application prototype. They facilitate the involvement of mobile devices in collaborative work as well as the support of users during voting and ranking processes.},

abstract = {The notion of implicit (or explicit) collaborative information access refers to systems and practices allowing a group of users to unintentionally (respectively intentionally) seek, share and retrieve information to achieve similar (respectively shared) information-related goals. Despite an increasing adoption in social environments, collaboration behavior in information seeking and retrieval is mainly limited to small-sized groups, generally restricted to working spaces. Much remains to be learned about collaborative information seeking within open web social spaces. This paper is an attempt to better understand either implicit or explicit collaboration by studying Twitter, one of the most popular and widely used social networks. We study in particular the complex intertwinement of human interactions induced by both collaboration and social networking. We empirically explore explicit collaborative interactions based on focused conversation streams during two crisis. We identify structural patterns of temporally representative conversation subgraphs and represent their topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling. Our main findings suggest that: 1) the critical mass of collaboration is generally limited to small-sized flat networks, with or without an influential user, 2) users are active as members of weakly overlapping groups and engage in numerous collaborative search and sharing tasks dealing with different topics, and 3) collaborative group ties evolve within the time-span of conversations.},

To construct repeatable collaborative processes requires understanding as the process is actually practiced and on the other hand, evaluate the effectiveness of the designed collaborative processes. In this paper, the CSACE (Case Study based Analysis in Collaboration Engineering) method is presented. CSACE is based on a case study methodology for covering the collaborative needs and evaluate if these needs have been covered by the proposed processes, both in an empirical way. The CSACE method was applied for modeling two collaborative processes analyzed and evaluated inside two different learning environments using the study case as validation method. Results in this study case show that the CSACE method is useful and effective in the incremental definition of empirical collaborative processes.},

abstract = {To bridge the increasing processor-disk performance gap, buffer caches are used in both storage clients (e.g. database systems) and storage servers to reduce the number of slow disk accesses. These buffer caches need to be managed effectively to deliver the performance commensurate to the aggregate buffer cache size. To address this problem, two paradigms have been proposed recently to collaboratively manage these buffer caches together: the hierarchy-aware caching maintains the same I/O interface and is fully transparent to the storage client software, and the aggressively-collaborative caching trades off transparency for performance and requires changes to both the interface and the storage client software. Before storage industry starts to implement collaborative caching in real systems, it is crucial to find out whether sacrificing transparency is really worthwhile, i.e., how much can we gain by using the aggressively-collaborative caching instead of the hierarchy-aware caching? To accurately answer this question, it is required to consider all possible combinations of recently proposed local replacement algorithms and optimization techniques in both collaboration paradigms.Our study provides an empirical evaluation to address the above questions. Particularly, we have compared three aggressively-collaborative approaches with two hierarchy-aware approaches for four different types of database/file I/O workloads using traces collected from real commercial systems such as IBM DB2. More importantly, we separate the effects of collaborative caching from local replacement algorithms and optimizations, and uniformly apply several recently proposed local replacement algorithms and optimizations to all five collaboration approaches.When appropriate local optimizations and replacement algorithms are uniformly applied to both hierarchy-aware and aggressively-collaborative caching, the results indicate that hierarchy-aware caching can deliver similar performance as aggressively-collaborative caching. The results show that the aggressively-collaborative caching only provides less than 2.5% performance improvement on average in simulation and 1.0% in real system experiments over the hierarchy-aware caching for most workloads and cache configurations. Our sensitivity study indicates that the performance gain of aggressively-collaborative caching is also very small for various storage networks and different cache configurations. Therefore, considering its simplicity and generality, hierarchy-aware caching is more feasible than aggressively-collaborative caching.},

abstract = {Due to the openness of wireless medium, robotic networks that consist of many miniaturized robots are susceptible to Sybil attackers, who can fabricate myriads of fictitious robots. Such detrimental attacks can overturn the fundamental trust assumption in robotic collaboration and thus impede widespread deployments of robotic networks in many collaborative tasks. Existing solutions rely on bulky multi-antenna systems to passively obtain fine-grained physical layer signatures, making them unaffordable to miniaturized robots. To overcome this limitation, we present ScatterID, a lightweight system that attaches featherlight and batteryless backscatter tags to single-antenna robots for Sybil attack mitigation. Instead of passively “observing” signatures, ScatterID actively “manipulates” multipath propagation by exploiting backscatter tags to intentionally create rich multipath signatures obtainable to single-antenna robots. Particularly, these signatures are used to carefully construct similarity vectors to thwart advanced Sybil attackers, who further trigger power-scaling and colluding attacks to generate dissimilar signatures. Then, a customized random forest model is developed to accurately infer the identity legitimacy of each robot. We implement ScatterID on the iRobot Create platform and evaluate it under various Sybil attacks in real-world environments. The experimental results show that ScatterID achieves a high AUROC of 0.987 and obtains an overall accuracy of 95.4% under basic and advanced Sybil attacks. Specifically, it can successfully detect 96.1% of fake robots while mistakenly rejecting just 5.7% of legitimate ones.},

abstract = {Smartphones are gradually providing support for advanced user applications with high computation and network bandwidth requirements. However, their usually restricted size raises usability issues. A need is emerging for utilization and collaboration with devices in the user's reach that provide advanced capabilities. The 3GPP IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is making an important contribution toward this direction, through specifications for distribution and replication of a multimedia session's media components to multiple devices that either belong to the same or different subscriptions. The IMS Service Continuity capability enables the transfer of one or more media components of an IMS session across different user devices. Although IMS can handle the media flow transfer, the user is still required to be engaged in a tedious device discovery and configuration process. We propose an out-of-band signaling mechanism, based on Near Field Communication (NFC) connectivity for fast and effortless initialization of a collaborative multimedia session between devices in close proximity that may involve the transfer of one or more media flows among them. We specify the utilization of an intuitive NFC touch interface for (a) user and device discovery and (b) negotiation of media stream properties (e.g. encoding, transport protocol) during the transfer of a media flow among different devices.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of a NATO open-access protocol for underwater acoustic communications intended to facilitate interoperability among deployed marine assets. NATO has established an advisory committee with a mandate to review the technical specification and the considered applications as this scheme makes its way to a NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG). The purpose of this paper is to acquaint the community with the technology and to use the international collaboration as an example of the process required to establish a Standard.Underwater (UW) communication capabilities are currently manufacturer-specific, with no international standards for digital coding protocols. Different manufacturers provide different UW communication capabilities, generally using proprietary digital coding technologies. Presently, there exists no general interoperable capability for digital UW communication between assets using modems from different manufacturers.An interoperability capability is essential as maritime operators seek to integrate an increasingly heterogeneous mix of maritime assets. Many autonomous Underwater Vehicles, surface craft, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, moored ocean sensing systems, gateway buoys and floats depend on underwater acoustic communications for command, control and information sharing. There is currently no existing capability for these to communicate UW with each other unless they carry matching equipment from the same manufacturer. There also are no existing means to discover other communicating assets to permit the formation of ad-hoc networks. Among the several manufacturers of UW digital modems, only a very few claim to be able to communicate with systems produced by other manufacturers. The establishment of an UW digital communications standard therefore has wide application in both military and civilian contexts.The requirement is for communication interoperability between UW military and civilian maritime assets to facilitate digital UW communication and, additionally, the ad-hoc networked coordination and sharing of information among underwater sensors, surface ships, submarines, AUVs, gateway buoys and sensor networks, covering the transmission and reception of many types of information and providing a communications service that compliments that offered by existing systems.},

abstract = {Today's computing is characterized by an increasing degree of complexity, comprehensiveness and collaboration. The complexity can be observed by the wide application of gigantic models with a huge number of parameters and structures of an unprecedented level of sophistication. The comprehensiveness is best illustrated by the high heterogeneity of data both in terms of format and source. The collaboration, finally, becomes an obvious trend when computing systems grow more open and decentralized in which various entities interact to achieve collective intelligence with the presence of potentially malicious behavior. Trust, therefore, has become critical at multiple levels: At model level to assure its integrity, fairness and interpretability; At data level to safeguard data quality, compliance and privacy; At system level to govern resilience, performance and incentive. Moreover, the notion of trust has long been discussed in different domains in both academia and industry with different definition and understanding. The Third International Workshop on Smart Data for Blockchain and Distributed Ledger (SDBD'21) will be held as a joint workshop with the special-themed "Trust Day" of KDD 2021, which has therefore aimed to bring together researchers, practitioners and experts from various communities to exchange and explore ideas, frontiers, opportunities and challenges under the broad theme of "trust" in a highly interdisciplinary manner.},

abstract = {A collaborative Virtual Reality System (VRS) software with X3D interactive visualization has been developed for the RAPID Code System. The software is named “VRS-RAPID”. VRS-RAPID has several key features including an intuitive and fast input preparation; on-the-fly simulation of nuclear systems using RAPID; 3D, 2D, and tabular visualization of RAPID outputs; nuclear inspection and detection capabilities; and possibility for collaboration of users at different sites. The latter feature provides an excellent capability for training of students and professionals. Different layers of X3D models are used for the visualization of the nuclear system and to display the code output and the system environment. VRS-RAPID can be accessed via a web browser from a variety of devices, including computers, tablets, and smart-phones. The current version of VRS-RAPID includes databases for simulation of Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Pools, SNF Casks, and nuclear reactor cores. The RAPID code system is developed based on the innovative Multi-stage Response-function Transport (MRT) methodology, that has been thoroughly benchmark and allows for real-time simulation of nuclear systems. Although developed for coupling with the nuclear code system RAPID, the VRS can be adapted to the modeling and simulation of any physics. The goal of the VRS system is to enable real-time computation and analysis of real-life nuclear systems in a collaborative setting for professionals and students, even far apart from each other; as well as simplifying the input preparation and output processing of complex scientific computing software.},

In this article, we combine relevant literature, past research, and a small-scale empirical study of two people individually and collaboratively constructing jigsaws. The objective is to make progress towards the goal of generating extensions to an existing task modeling approach, Task Knowledge Structures. The research described has enabled us to generate requirements for approaches to modeling collaborative tasks and also a set of requirements to be taken into account in the design of a computer-based collaborative virtual jigsaw.},

abstract = {Device Model Generalization (DMG) is a practical yet under-investigated research topic for on-device machine learning applications. It aims to improve the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG. Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary. We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework (DUET). DUET is deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and device as a “duet” collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm our framework’s effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks.},

abstract = {The cloud-edge collaborative inference demands scheduling the artificial intelligence (AI) tasks efficiently to the appropriate edge smart device. However, the continuously iterative deep neural networks (DNNs) and heterogeneous devices pose great challenges for inference tasks scheduling. In this paper, we propose a self-update cloud-edge collaborative inference scheduling system (Sniper) with time awareness. At first, considering that similar networks exhibit similar behaviors, we develop a non-invasive performance characterization network (PCN) based on neural network similarity (NNS) to accurately predict the inference time of DNNs. Moreover, PCN and time-based scheduling algorithms can be flexibly combined into the scheduling module of Sniper. Experimental results show that the average relative error of network inference time prediction is about 8.06%. Compared with the traditional method without time awareness, Sniper can reduce the waiting time by 52% on average while achieving a stable increase in throughput.},

abstract = {Multi-user applications generally lag behind in features or compatibility with single-user applications. As a result, users are often not motivated to abandon their favorite single-user applications for groupware features that are less frequently used. A well-accepted approach, collaboration transparency, is able to convert off-the-shelf single-user applications into groupware without modifying the source code. However, existing systems have been largely striving to develop generic application-sharing mechanisms and undesirably force users to share the same application in cooperative work. In this paper we analyze this problem and present a novel approach (called intelligent collaboration transparency) to addressing this problem. Our approach allows for heterogeneous application sharing by considering the particular semantics of the applications and the collaboration task in question.},

Instructional measures are being developed to improve the quality of the collaboration which itself determines to a great extent the results of working and learning in groups. However, assessing collaborative process is not easy. We have developed a new assessment method by quantitatively rating nine qualitatively defined characteristic dimensions of collaboration. In this paper, we first describe how these dimensions were extracted from video-recordings of dyads collaborating to solve interdisciplinary tasks. Then we explain how the resulting rating system was applied to and tested on another sample. Based on positive findings from this application, we argue that the new method can be recommended for different areas of CSCL research.},

abstract = {Trust is a central element for effective teamwork and successful human-technology collaboration. Although technologies, such as agents, are increasingly becoming autonomous team members operating alongside humans, research on team trust in human-agent teams is missing. Thus far, empirical and theoretical work have focused on aspects of trust only towards the agent as a technology neglecting how team trust - with regards to the human-agent team as a whole - develops. In this paper, we present a model of team trust in human-agent teams combining two streams of research: (1) theories of trust in human teams and (2) theories of human-computer interaction (HCI). We propose different antecedents (integrity, ability, benevolence) that influence team trust in human-agent teams as well as individual, team, system, and temporal factors that impact this relationship. The goal of the present article is to advance our understanding of team trust in human-agent teams and encourage an integration between HCI and team research when planning future research. This will also help to design trustworthy human-agent teams and thereby, when introducing human-agent teams, support organizational functioning.},

Prior research shows that collaborative approaches to NDRAs with input from passengers can help to reduce these effects. Nevertheless, there is no systematic work on how to support collaboration in the car. In this paper, we designed and evaluated five concepts that exemplify different collaborative approaches with the goal of studying in-vehicle collaboration. Our results provide insights into how these approaches affect collaboration through the measures of (1) social connectedness (connectedness, affiliation, belongingness, companionship) and (2) team performance (coordination effectiveness, team cohesion). We found that Anarchic or Hierarchical control empower front-seat passengers, reduce power dynamics, and minimize driver distraction (caused by interacting passengers). We discuss the implications of these findings and posit recommendations to design future IVIS in passenger cars with improved driver-passenger collaboration.},

This study explores how collaborative innovation works in the field of data analysis by examining five data-centric collaborative projects initiated by a private company in Taiwan. These projects address important social issues such as domestic violence and poverty. Interviews of government and non-government actors revealed that these collaborative projects are suitable for experiments with new ideas and systems. The transformative learning process that occurred in the collaboration project illustrates the advantage of enlisting the support of people from different fields. The outcomes of collaboration brought new insights to predict the risk of domestic violence or other threats to children and adolescents, or the success rate of participants in job training programs. The diffusion of the collaborative model was also observed. However, there are several barriers to collaborative innovation and issues of equity, challenges to privacy and accountability, and the application of collaborative outcomes. This study brings us closer to understanding how collaborative innovation operates and can inform public managers on how to promote data-centric collaborative innovation in the future.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous roaming sensor systems have gained significant importance in many domains of civil infrastructure performance inspection as they accelerate data collection and analysis. However, designing such systems is challenging due to the immense complexity in the heterogeneity and processing demands of the involved sensors. Unifying frameworks are needed to simplify development, deployment and operation of roaming sensors and computing units.To address the sensing needs, we propose SIROM3, a Scalable Intelligent Roaming Multi-Modal Multi-Sensor framework. SIROM3 incorporates a CPS approach for infrastructure performance monitoring to address the following challenges: 1. Scalability and expandability. It offers a scalable and expandable solution enabling diversity in sensing and the growth in processing platforms from sensors to control centers. 2. Fusion foundations. SIROM3 enables fusion of data collected by logically and geo-spatially distributed sensors. 3. Big data handling. Automatic collection, categorization, storage and manipulation of heterogeneous large volume of data streams. 4. Automation. SIROM3 minimizes human interaction through full automation from data acquisition to visualization of the fused results.Illustrated in Fig. 1, SIROM3 realizes scalability and expandability in a system-level design approach encapsulating common functionality across hierarchical components in a Run-Time Environment (RTE). The RTE deploys a layered design paradigm defining services in both software and hardware architectures. Equipped with multiple RTE-enabled Multi-Sensor Aggregators (MSA), an array of Roaming Sensor Systems (RSS) operate as mobile agents attached to vehicles to provide distributed computing services regulated by Fleet Control and Management (FCM) center via communication network. A series of foundational services including the Precise Timing Protocol (PTP), GPS timing systems, Distance Measurement Instruments (DMI) through middleware services (CORBA) embedded in the RTE build the fusion foundations for data correlation and analysis. A Heterogeneous Stream File-system Overlay (HSFO) alleviates the big data challenge. It facilitates storing, processing, categorizing and fusing large heterogeneous data stream collected by versatile sensors. A GIS visualization module is integrated for visual analysis and monitoring.SIROM3 enables coordination and collaboration across sensors, MSAs and RSSes, which produce high volume of heterogeneous data stored in HSFO. To fuse the data efficiently, SIROM3 contains an expandable plugin system (part of RTE) for rapid algorithm prototyping using data streams in the architectural hierarchy (i.e. from MSAs to FCM) via the HSFO API. This makes an ideal test-bed to develop new algorithms and methodologies expanding CPS principles to civil infrastructure performance monitoring. In result, SIROM3 simplifies the development, construction and operation of roaming multi-modal multi-sensor systems.We demonstrate the efficiency of SIROM3 by automating the assessment of road surface conditions at the city scale. We realized an RSS with 6 MSAs and 30 heterogeneous sensors, including radars, microphones, GPS and cameras, all deployed onto a van sponsored by the VOTERS (Versatile Onboard Traffic Embedded Roaming Sensors) project. Over 20 terabytes of data have been collected, aggregated, fused, analyzed and geo-spatially visualized using SIROM3 for studying the pavement conditions of the city of Brockton, MA covering 300 miles. The expandability of SIROM3 is shown by adding a millimeter-wave radar needing less than 50 lines of C++ code for system integration. SIROM3 offers a unified solution for comprehensive roadway assessment and evaluation. The integrated management of big data (from collection to automated processing) is an ideal research platform for automated assessment of civil infrastructure performance.},

We observe that energy-aware programs may identify different ways (called options) to achieve the desired functionalities and choose the most energy-efficient option at runtime. Our framework provides a programming interface to obtain the estimated energy consumption for choosing a particular option. The energy is estimated based on runtime energy characterization that records a set of runtime conditions correlated with the energy consumption of the options. We provide the procedure and general guidelines for using the environment to construct energy-aware programs. The prototype demonstrates that (a) energy-aware applications can be programmed easily with our interface, (b) accurate estimates are achieved by integrating multiple runtime conditions, and (c) the framework can make multiple devices collaborate for significant energy savings (15% to 41%) with negligible time and energy overhead (&lt;0.35%).},

abstract = {Autonomous manipulation has made tremendous progress in recent years, leveraging new algorithms and capabilities of mobile manipulators to address complex human environments. However, most current systems inadequately address one key feature of human environments: that they are populated with humans. What would it take for a human and robot to prepare a meal together in a kitchen, or to assemble a part together in a manufacturing workcell?Collaboration with humans is the next frontier in robotics, be it shared workspace collaboration, assistive teleoperation and sliding autonomy, or teacher-learner collaboration, and raises new challenges for both robotics and HRI. A collaborative robot must engage in a delicate dance of prediction and action, where it must understand its collaborator's intentions, act to make its own intentions clear, decide when to assist and when to back off, as well as continuously adapt its behavior and enable customization.Addressing these challenges demands a joint effort from the HRI and robotics communities. We believe that this workshop will not only serve to attract more roboticists into the HRI community under this unifying theme, but will also create much needed collaborations to explore this rich, interdisciplinary area.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of interaction behaviors in multimedia information systems, where multi-behavior recommender systems have received increasing attention by leveraging data from various auxiliary behaviors such as tip and collect. Among various multi-behavior recommendation methods, non-sampling methods have shown superiority over negative sampling methods. However, two observations are usually ignored in existing state-of-the-art non-sampling methods based on binary regression: (1) users have different preference strengths for different items, so they cannot be measured simply by binary implicit data; (2) the dependency across multiple behaviors varies for different users and items. To tackle the above issue, we propose a novel non-sampling learning framework named Criterion-guided Heterogeneous Collaborative Filtering (CHCF). CHCF introduces both upper and lower thresholds to indicate selection criteria, which will guide user preference learning. Besides, CHCF integrates criterion learning and user preference learning into a unified framework, which can be trained jointly for the interaction prediction of the target behavior. We further theoretically demonstrate that the optimization of Collaborative Metric Learning can be approximately achieved by the CHCF learning framework in a non-sampling form effectively. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the effectiveness of CHCF in heterogeneous scenarios.},

In particular, we focus on collaboration and sharing of resources in an infrastructure as a service cloud, where compute resources complemented with storage and networking are offered as a service to customers by cloud service providers. We develop a multi-cloud trust model at different scopes of administration. At cloud level, infrastructure resources can be shared between clouds. At lower administrative scopes, cloud service providers are able to share their resources and service instances among customers within multiple clouds. Finally, we formally specify the administrative aspects of multi-cloud collaboration models we develop. We have implemented a proof of concept prototype based on the administrative model of OpenStack, the de facto open-source software for building infrastructure as a service clouds.},

abstract = {A prototype Taskspaces framework for grid computing of scientific computing problems that require intertask communication is presented. The Taskspaces framework is characterized by three major design choices: decentralization provided by an underlying tuple space concept, enhanced direct communication between tasks by means of a communication tuple space distributed over the worker hosts, and object orientation and platform independence realized by implementation in Java. Grid administration tasks, for example resetting worker nodes, are performed by mobile agent objects. We report on large-scale grid computing experiments for iterative linear algebra applications showing that our prototype framework scales well for scientific computing problems that require neighbor-neighbor intertask communication. It is shown in a computational fluid dynamics simulation using a Lattice Boltzmann method that the Taskspaces framework can be used naturally in interactive collaboration mode. The scalable Taskspaces framework runs fully transparently on heterogeneous grids while maintaining a low complexity in terms of installation, maintenance, application programming and grid operation. It thus offers a promising roadway to push scientific grid computing with intertask communication beyond the experimental research setting.},

abstract = {Assistive technology devices for the visually impaired form a small part of a much wider support infrastructure of people and systems that cluster about a particular disability. Various disabilities, in turn, form part of a greater ecosystem of sometimes isolated support teams. These may cluster about a nucleus of various specific disabilities, such as vision impairment, speech or hearing loss, each focusing on their own particular disability category. Teams are comprised of therapists, caregivers, trainers, as well as device manufacturers, who design and produce computer-based systems such as mobility aids. There is, however, little evidence of any real crossover collaboration or communication between different disability support teams and a disparate cottage industry of manufacturers. The author proposes a collaborative digital ecosystem framework that may assist this challenge. Although this paper is not a survey of all available devices, examples of some commercial systems are cited in order to draw attention to user interface challenges that confront both those who rely on them....and those who design them.},

abstract = {Interest in the applications of Extended Reality is growing across many different domains. Collaborative or shared experiences are seen as a primary use case. However, there is a surprisingly little research efforts on collaborative design tasks not considering social experiences using Virtual Reality (VR). In addition, there are very few research studies that have focused on the Quality of Experience (QoE) of small user groups working together on collaborative tasks. In this paper, the authors present the results of an experimental study conducted to understand user experience of collaborative tasks using Virtual Reality. The paper presents some initial analysis from self-reported questionnaire data. Two users allocated different roles (Describer and Finder) join remotely to perform the design task collaboratively in immersive VR. The results presented compare user QoE between the two groups (Describer Group vs Finder Group) and considers how different roles and position produces different levels of immersion, interaction, collaboration, post-usage acceptability and system-related consequences. Self-reported measures via post-test questionnaire (15-questions) shows statistically-significant differences in terms of the perceived QoE aspects between the two groups.},

The present paper focuses on the specific category of remote-collaboration systems where hand gestures are used by a remote helper to assist a physically distant worker to perform manual tasks. Existing systems use a combination of video capturing, 2D monitors or 2D projectors, however displaying a video of the remote workspace and allowing helpers to gesture over the video does not provide helpers with sufficient understanding of the spatial relationships between remote objects and between their hands and the remote objects. In this paper we introduce our tele-presence Mixed Reality system for remote collaboration on physical tasks based on real-time capture and rendering of the remote workspace and of the helper's hands. We improve on previous 2D systems introducing 3D capturing and rendering, and exploiting the possibility offered by the use of real 3D data to increase the feeling of immersion offered by the system using head tracking, stereoscopic rendering, inter-occlusion handling and virtual shadowing. We performed initial usability test of our system to verify if users are satisfied with the spatial awareness the system provides.},

This is an important but difficult (and error prone) task that cannot be done without information about the behavioral semantics of each model. In this paper, we introduce an integrated development environment which allows 1) to import different executable models (named simulation units), 2) to graphically connect them with rich connectors and 3) to generate a dedicated, accurate and efficient distributed co-simulation. The framework is based on Eclipse EMF for the modeling part and on \O{}MQ for the deployment. It is named CoSim20},

To address such problems, we introduce a collaborative privacy management framework, which aims to provide fine-grained data privacy protection for both data owners and data involvers in a distributed manner. Based on individual privacy policies specified by each user, a collaborative privacy policy is generated and enforced on different devices automatically.

Tool support for such collaboration is often lacking, especially with regards to consistency between different engineering artifacts (e.g., between model and code or requirements and specifications). Current collaboration tools, such as version control systems, are not able to address these cross-artifact consistency concerns. The consequence is unnecessarily complex consistency maintenance during engineering. This paper explores consistent handling of engineering artifacts during collaborative engineering. This work presumes that all engineers collaborate using a joint, cloud-based engineering environment and engineering artifacts are continuously synchronized with this environment. The artifacts can be read and modified by both engineers and analysis mechanisms such as a consistency checker. The paper enumerates different consistency checking scenarios that arise during such collaboration.},

abstract = {Given that cognitive capabilities of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often have huge differences, especially due to their deployments in highly personal environments, it is plausible that collaborating IoT devices for cognition can lead to higher accuracy. However, designing a collaborative cognition mechanism for resource-constrained IoT devices is challenging because the collaboration needs to involve a subset of IoT devices, yet still be accurate. Although existing methods (e.g., ensemble pruning) can help the models to ensemble without sacrificing accuracy, these approaches only consider accuracy without computational cost, which is especially important for resource-scarce IoT devices. In this paper, we propose RC2, a resource-efficient collaborative cognition approach for IoT devices collaboration. We propose to explicitly incorporate computational cost information into the main objective so that the approach can obtain a collaboration that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. We conduct empirical evaluation of our method compared with two state-of-the-art methods; and the evaluation shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

A novel, complete end-to-end system was developed, which extracts data from a live human group demonstration, and allows the robots to imitate the demonstration by adapting the demonstration dataset to the current, possibly different environment. The complete system was evaluated using a series of increasingly difficult benchmark experiments, including a collaborative door opening experiment using a group of heterogeneous robots. The results showed, that the system is resistant to changes in the environment, as it was possible to give a demonstration in one environment, move the robots to a physically different but similar location, where the robots could still imitate the demonstration in this new context. The door opening experiment also shows that this system can be used to demonstrate and learn collaborative behaviour. Our results demonstrate a novel and promising method for teaching a group of robots to perform a joint task by human team demonstration.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) allows virtual object projection with an unblocked view of the physical world which provides reference and other people. The mixed scene provides an agile platform for communication and collaboration, especially on a product that would be difficult or expensive to present otherwise. In the boating industry, high customization leaves dealers with a high cost on inventory, financially and spatially. In this work, we present BoatAR, a multi-user AR boat configuration system designed for addressing these issues. A prototype system was implemented using HoloLens with shared experience, and demonstrated to a group of boat dealers and received positive feedback. BoatAR provided an example of how a multi-user AR system could help in the conventional industry.},

abstract = {Federated learning is an emerging paradigm that provides privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple participants for model training without sharing private data. The participants with heterogeneous devices and networking resources decelerate the training and aggregation. The dataset of the participant also possesses a high level of variability, which means the characteristics of the dataset change over time. Moreover, it is a prerequisite to preserve the personalized characteristics of the local dataset on each participant device to achieve better performance. This article proposes a model personalization-based federated learning approach in the presence of variability in the local datasets. The approach involves participants with heterogeneous devices and networking resources. The central server initiates the approach and constructs a base model that executes on most participants. The approach simultaneously learns the personalized model and handles the variability in the datasets. We propose a knowledge distillation-based early-halting approach for devices where the base model does not fit directly. The early halting speeds up the training of the model. We also propose an aperiodic global update approach that helps participants to share their updated parameters aperiodically with server. Finally, we perform a real-world study to evaluate the performance of the approach and compare with state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Social interaction mediated by information technology has been studied from several perspectives over the past years. This paper draws attention to the relevance of classification systems and categories as important mediation artifacts in human-computer interaction. In this sense, classification schemes provide meaning to information and mutual understanding between the parts in an interaction. However, studies in distributed cognition show us that classification schemes have a flexible nature and depend on the context in everyday human activity. Under this perspective, this paper analyzes three approaches to classification in the web: the semantic web, collaborative annotation and hybrid approaches. The analyses are based on the concept of communities of practice and on the perspective of context as a problem of social interaction in these communities. Based on these theoretical works, this paper derives two design principles for web classification systems: firstly, collaboration allows for participating users to be active agents in content classification. Secondly, multidimensionality permits the co-existence and management of multiple classification perspectives, which is of fundamental importance in complex, heterogeneous and large-scale infrastructures such as the web.},

abstract = {A key issue in process-aware e-commerce collaboration is to orchestrate business processes of multiple business partners throughout a supply chain network in an automated and seamless way. Since each partner has its own internal processes with different control flow structures and message interfaces, the real challenge lies in verifying the correctness of process collaboration, and reconciling conflicts in an automated manner to make collaboration successful. The purpose of business process adaptation is to mediate the communication between independent processes to overcome their mismatches and incompatibilities. The goal of this article is to develop and compare efficient approaches of optimal adapter (i.e. one that minimizes the number of messages to be adapted) creation for multiple interacting processes under both synchronous and asynchronous communication. We start with an analysis of interactions of each message pair, and show how to identify incompatible cases and their adaptation elements for both types of communication. Then, we show how to extend this analysis into more general cases involving M messages and N processes (M, N &gt; 2). Further, we present optimal adapter creation algorithms for both scenarios based on our analysis technique. The algorithms were implemented in a Java-based prototype system, and results of two experiments are reported. We compare and discuss the insights gained about adapter creation in these two scenarios.},

abstract = {A Proprietary Software Ecosystem (PSECO) comprises a common technological platform with contributions protected by intellectual property. The social aspects of software development in a PSECO involve iterations in different scenarios, such as collaboration, teamwork, and productivity. Power relationships among actors within an ecosystem are a key social aspect. They may cause community smells, i.e., unforeseen socio-technical events that may result in additional costs to the project. If social aspects are recognized especially in PSECO, the IT management team may develop governance strategies to deal with them. This work investigates power relationships and community smells in PSECO, focusing on one of their components: actors. To identify the existing community smells, a systematic mapping study was performed. Results revealed that social aspects are barely explored in PSECO. Such opportunity motivated us to explore power relationships dynamics in PSECO through a focus group. The focus group raised 17 power relationship dynamics in PSECO. Our work highlighted behavioral issues in PSECO related to community smells and power relationships.},

We developed an online visual analysis system called OCEANS to address this topic by allowing close collaboration among security analysts to create deeper insights in detecting network events. Loading the heterogeneous data source (netflow, IPS log and host status log), OCEANS provides a multi-level visualization showing temporal overview, IP connections and detailed connections. Participants can submit their findings through the visual interface and refer to others' existing findings. Users can gain inspiration from each other and collaborate on finding subtle events and targeting multi-phase attacks. Our case study confirms that OCEANS is intuitive to use and can improve efficiency. The crowd collaboration helps the users comprehend the situation and reduce false alarms.},

abstract = {The penetration of mobile devices in our daily life (also called the mobile market) as well as their constantly growing technical capabilities has been going along in the last years with an increasing interest from side of the research community. Hence, heterogeneous mobile operating systems populated the current mobile market and have led to the following problem. Many providers of mobile services, e.g., developers of business or learning applications that provide personalised content, are mostly forced into the restrictions of implementing solutions for just a number of mobile device types and just within the limits of one domain area. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues within the area of technology-enhanced learning by focusing on two interrelated aspects. On the one side, we give an overview on the challenges regarding the development of services for this currently existing heterogeneity of mobile platforms. And on the other side, we show our main findings after asking university students which services they would like to use for their personal learning needs to increase collaborative campus-life activities with their mobile devices. Our field study showed a shift from the 'typical' perspective of optimising learning content provision to a more general perspective of delivering collaborative services with ad-hoc mobile networks. Based on those aspects, we introduce also the system architecture of our solution approach focusing on its communication layers that support shared connectivity for ubiquitous services.},

In the past years, various notification strategies have been designed for different systems. However, the design of notification components has been ad hoc, and the techniques used for supporting notification have been application-dependent. In this paper, we contribute a flexible notification framework that can be used to describe and compare a range of notification strategies used in existing collaborative systems, and to guide the design of notification components for new collaborative systems. The framework has been applied to the design of a notification component for a group editor, which uses a single notification mechanism to support various notification policies for meeting both real-time and non-real-time collaboration needs. In addition, a new operational transformation control algorithm has been devised in combination with the notification component, which is significantly simpler and more efficient than existing algorithms.},

Different from traditional academic search systems that focus on document (paper) search, AMiner aims to provide a systematic modeling approach for researchers (authors), ultimately to gain a deep understanding of the big (heterogeneous) network formed by authors, papers they have published, and venues they published those papers. The system extracts researchers' profiles automatically from the Web and integrates the researcher profiles with publication papers after name disambiguation. For now, the system has collected a big scholar data with more than 130,000,000 researcher profiles and 100,000,000 papers from multiple publication databases. We also developed an approach named COSNET to connect AMiner with several professional social networks such as LinkedIn and VideoLectures, which significantly enriches the metadata of the scholarly data. Based on the integrated big scholar data, we devise a unified topic modeling approach for modeling the different entities (authors, papers, venues) simultaneously and provide a topic-level expertise search by leveraging the modeling results. In addition, AMiner offers a set of researcher-centered functions including social influence analysis, influence visualization, collaboration recommendation, relationship mining, similarity analysis and community evolution. The system has been put into operation since 2006 and has attracted more than 7,000,000 independent IP accesses from over 200 countries/regions.},

abstract = {Advances in scientific domains are led to an increase in the complexity of the experiments. To address this growing complexity, scientists from different domains require to work collaboratively. Scientific Workflow Management Systems (SWfMSs) are popular tools for data-intensive experiments. To the best of our knowledge, very few of the existing SWfMSs support collaboration, and it is not efficient in many cases. Researchers share a single version of the workflow in existing collaborative data analysis systems, which increases the chance of interference as the number of collaborators grows. Moreover, for effective collaboration, contributors require a clear view of the project's status, the information that existing SWfMSs do not provide. Another significant problem is most scientists are not capable of adding collaborative tools to existing SWfMSs, and they need software engineers to take on this responsibility. Even for software engineers such tasks could be challenging and time consuming. In this paper, we attempted to address this crucial issue in scientific workflow composition and doing so in a collaborative setting. Hence, we propose a tool to facilitate collaborative workflow composition. This tool provides branching and versioning, which are standard version control system features to allow multiple researchers to contribute to the project asynchronously. We also suggest some visualizations and a variety of reports to increase group awareness and help the scientists to realize the project's status and issues. As a proof of concept, we developed an API to capture the provenance data and provide collaborative tools. This API is developed as an example for software engineers to help them understand how to integrate collaborative tools into any SWfMS. We collect provenance information during workflow composition and then employ it to track workflow versions using the proposed collaborative tool. Prior to implementing the visualizations, we surveyed to discover how much the proposed visualizations could contribute to group awareness. Moreover, in the survey we investigated to what extent the proposed version control system could help address shortcomings in collaborative experiments. The survey participants provided us with valuable feedback. In future, we will use the survey responses to enhance the proposed version control system and visualizations.},

abstract = {Co-locating Latency-Critical (LC) and Best-Effort (BE) services in edge-clouds is expected to enhance resource utilization. However, this mixed deployment encounters unique challenges. Edge-clouds are heterogeneous, distributed, and resource-constrained, leading to intense competition for edge resources, making it challenging to balance fluctuating co-located workloads. Previous works in cloud datacenters are no longer applicable since they do not consider the unique nature of edges. Although very few works explicitly provide specific schemes for edge workload co-location, these solutions fail to address the major challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Tango, a harmonious management and scheduling framework for Kubernetes-based edge-cloud systems with mixed services, to address these challenges. Tango incorporates novel components and mechanisms for elastic resource allocation and two traffic scheduling algorithms that effectively manage distributed edge resources. Tango demonstrates harmony not only in the compatible mixed services it supports, but also in the collaborative solutions that complement each other. Based on a backwards compatible design for Kubernetes, Tango enhances Kubernetes with automatic scaling and traffic scheduling capabilities. Experiments on large-scale hybrid edge-clouds, driven by real workload traces, show that Tango improves the system resource utilization by 36.9%, QoS-guarantee satisfaction rate by 11.3%, and throughput by 47.6%, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, FL comes with the challenge of performing training over largely heterogeneous datasets, devices, and networks that are out of the control of the centralized FL server. Motivated by this inherent setting, we make a first step towards characterizing the impact of device and behavioral heterogeneity on the trained model. We conduct an extensive empirical study spanning close to 1.5K unique configurations on five popular FL benchmarks. Our analysis shows that these sources of heterogeneity have a major impact on both model performance and fairness, thus shedding light on the importance of considering heterogeneity in FL system design.},

abstract = {Deviations from the original blueprints could often be found on building sites. To easily identify such constructional modifications, this paper proposes a smart digital twin for construction site monitoring that supports web-based collaboration with external experts to discuss possibly required solutions to this problem. Therefore, a system pipeline was designed that allows automatic detection and visualization of deviations between real and planning data. In addition, the pipeline allows generating an interactive difference visualization that uses the original planning data as well as the 3D scanned real data. The latter is recorded using an AR-capable mobile device or headset like the Microsoft HoloLens, whereas the mentioned differences are obtained via a point-cloud-based algorithm. The differences between real and planning data are then emphasized on the respective client, which uses X3DOM for visualization. Besides the server part of the pipeline, the application consists of several clients that enable a collaborative discussion between the various stakeholders, such as an AR-based mobile viewer for the craftsman on site and a web-based viewer for the building owner at home or the architect.},

However, technologies that allow collaboration between different form-factor devices are rare. While ubiquitous devices might serve individuals well, they don't support high levels of collaboration. We propose a system where groups can participate in onsite brainstorming using various form-factor devices: tablet, laptop, or desktop for collaboration. We utilize socket server technology to achieve a high level of synchronization for all individual actions during brainstorming. High rates of synchronization for real time collaboration is the key for usability and adaptability. Our system uses a method called affinity diagramming in which users illustrate, group and link their ideas to create an easily understood structure. Using ubiquitous devices - both mobile and stationary - in brainstorming can help teams work together to share resources, exchange and organize ideas to build solutions that enhance our lives.},

In this article, we propose a collaborative model based on the social interactions that take place in a web-based conversational group recommender system. The collaborative model allows the group recommender to implicitly infer the different roles within the group, namely, collaborative and leader user(s). Moreover, it serves as the basis of several novel collaboration-based consensus strategies that integrate both individual and social interactions in the group recommendation process. A live-user evaluation confirms that our approach accurately identifies the collaborative and leader users in a group and produces more effective recommendations.},

Knowledge work, however, typically occurs in partially overlapping subgroups and involves the use of multiple devices. We introduce co-Activity Manager, an ABC approach that (i) supports activity sharing for multiple collaborative contexts, (ii) includes collaborative tools into the activity abstraction and (iii) supports multiple devices by seamlessly integrated cloud support for documents and activity storage. Our 14 day field deployment in a multidisciplinary software development team showed that activity sharing is used as a starting point for long-term collaboration while integrated communication tools and cloud support are used extensively during the collaborative activities. The study also showed that activities are used in different ways ranging from project descriptions to to-do lists, thereby confirming that a document-driven activity roaming model seems to be a good match for collaborative knowledge work},

abstract = {Recent research has discovered the importance of informal roles in peer online collaboration. These roles reflect prototypical activity patterns of contributors such as different editing activities in writing communities. While previous work has analyzed the dynamics of contributors within single communities, so far, the relationship between individuals' roles and interaction among contributors remains unclear. This is a severe drawback given that collaboration is one of the driving forces in online communities. In this study, we use a network-based approach to combine information about individuals' roles and their interaction over time. We measure the impact of recurring subgraphs in co-author networks, so called motifs, on the overall quality of the resulting collaborative product. Doing so allows us to measure the effect of collaboration over mere isolated contributions by individuals. Our findings indicate that indeed there are consistent positive implications of certain patterns that cannot be detected when looking at contributions in isolation, e.g. we found shared positive effects of contributors that specialize on content quality over of quantity. The empirical results presented in this work are based on a study of several online writing communities, namely wikis from Wikia and Wikipedia.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Seventh Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2020, held virtually on August 12-14, 2020.Learning at Scale investigates large-scale, technology-mediated learning environments. The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. While the conference was originally inspired by the emergence of MOOCs, large-scale technology mediated learning environments are very diverse and the conference series is a venue for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by that diversity of environments. Intelligent tutoring systems, open learning courseware, learning games, citizen science communities, collaborative programming communities, community tutorial systems, and the countless informal communities of learners are all examples of learning at scale. These systems either depend upon large numbers of learners, or they are enriched through use of data generated by the previous use of many learners. They share a common purpose--to increase human potential--and a common infrastructure of data and computation to enable learning at scale.Investigations of learning at scale naturally bring together two different research communities. Learning scientists are drawn to these innovative environments to study established and emerging forms of knowledge production, transfer, modeling, and co-creation. Computer scientists are drawn to the field as a powerful site for the development and application of advanced computational techniques. At its very best, the Learning at Scale community supports the interdisciplinary investigation of these important sites of learning and human development.The goal of the Learning at Scale community is the understanding and enhancement of human learning. In emerging education technology genres, researchers often use a variety of proxy measures for learning, including measures of participation, persistence, completion, satisfaction, and activity. In the early stages of investigating a technological genre, it is entirely appropriate to begin lines of research by investigating these proxy outcomes. As lines of research mature, however, it is important for the community of researchers to hold each other to increasingly high standards and expectations for directly investigating thoughtfully constructed measures of learning. In the early days of research on MOOCs, many researchers documented correlations between measures of activity (videos watched, forums posted, clicks) and outcome proxies including participation, persistence, and completion. As learning at scale research matures, studies that document these kinds of correlations are giving way to studies of student learning that produce evidence of instructional techniques, technological infrastructures, learning habits, and experimental interventions that improve learning.In this year's call for papers, we solicited work in five areas of interest to grow our community whilst being inclusive to other work. Each area was represented by a community champion to answer questions about potential submissions and ensure high-quality reviewing in the area: Causal Inference at Scale (Champion: Thomas Staubitz) -- Studies that use digital learning environments with experimental designs to investigate factors that increase learning and refine theories by, for example, identifying sources of heterogeneity. Learning and Curriculum Analytics (Champion: Zach Pardos) -- Studies that analyze large educational datasets with data mining, ML, AI methods to advance our understanding of effective learning interactions and how to support learners. Qualitative Studies for/about L@S (Champion: Amy Ogan) -- Studies that take a qualitative or mixed-methods approach to understand learners' experiences and contextual factors in scaled or scalable learning environments to inform theory and/or design. Systems &amp; Tools for Learning (Champion: Chinmay Kulkarni) -- Studies that build and evaluate novel systems or tools for learning with designs that are grounded in research on how learning works. Synthesis Papers (Champion: Ido Roll)-- Studies that evaluate, synthesize, and contextualize existing bodies of knowledge and research to support collaboration.The call for papers attracted submissions from all over the world, covering a broad range of topics from the theoretical to the pragmatic. We received submissions on a variety of topics including: novel assessments of learning, drawing on computational techniques for automated, peer, or human-assisted assessment; new methods for validating inferences about human learning from established measures, assessments, or proxies; experimental interventions in large-scale learning environments that show evidence of improved learning outcomes; domain independent interventions inspired by social psychology, behavioral economics, and related fields with the potential to benefit learners in diverse fields and disciplines; domain specific interventions inspired by discipline-based educational research that have the potential to advance teaching and learning of specific ideas, misconceptions, and theories within a field; tools or techniques for personalization and adaptation, based on log data, user modeling, or choice; usability studies and effectiveness studies of design elements for students or instructors; tools and pedagogy to promote community, support learning, or increase retention in atscale environments; new tools and techniques for learning at scale; best practices in the archiving and reuse of learner data in safe, ethical ways; fairness in student predictive models; challenges in learning at scale across the globe; exploration of affordable degrees at scale; innovations in platforms for supporting learning at scale; and platforms to broadly engage individuals of all ages in citizen science. In all topics, we encourage the use of best practices in open science, including pre-planning and preregistration as well as a particular focus on contexts and populations that have been historically not well served.Our keynote speaker, Katie Davis shared insights from her recently published book, co-authored with Dr. Cecilia Aragon, titled Writers in the Secret Garden: Fanfiction, Youth, and New Forms of Mentoring in a talk titled -- What My Little Pony Can Teach Us About Interest-Driven Learning. Our keynote panel with Candace Thille (moderator), Ellen Wagner, Stephanie Teasley, Sidney D'Mello explored the ethics of learning at scale. The addition of workshops was well received this year with eight contributions. We also had glimpses into emerging work as 39 contributors shared their work in progress (WiPs) and demonstrations of their work.The COVID-19 pandemic and global attention to Black Lives Matter in response to George Floyd's killing have laid bare the equity gaps in education and generational racial inequities. Learning at Scale strives to be part of the solution and we have much room to improve. The work of our community is needed now more than ever. We added a call for abstracts on the impact of COVID-19 on virtual learning to the 2020 program. We commit to doing more to being inclusive in our programs, in terms of presenters, participants and work presented.},

We also design a lightweight GCN optimization method, which directly transfers the correlation between the image detection areas in projection to reduce computational redundancy. Our other contributions include performance analyses of models with different weights for industrial reference in practical applications. It is the first GCN-based image-text retrieval system to perform a real-time end-to-end search to the best of our knowledge. Experiments show that the system can process 20 image-to-text retrievals per second with high accuracy.},

However, in many application domains, the current systems do not sufficiently support collaborative work (sometimes they even don't support it at all). One good example is geographical information systems (GIS), that usually only follow an one user at one time approach. In this paper, we present the development of a scalable Multi-user Geographical Information System (MuGIS). With MuGIS it is now possible to integrate large display environments with mobile smart devices for remote control. The system is deployed as a client-server architecture. It uses the NASA World Wind Java framework and SOAP web services for communication. On the client side, all common mobile smart devices are supported. The underlying concept provides different user roles and multi-user identification.},

abstract = {To design computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW) systems that effectively support remote collaboration, designers need a better understanding of how people collaborate face-to-face and the mechanisms that they use to coordinate their actions. While research in CSCW has studied how specific social cues might facilitate collaboration in specific tasks, such as the role of gestures in video instruction, less is known about how a range of communicative cues might facilitate activities across many collaborative settings. In this paper, we model the predictive relationships between facial, gestural, and vocal cues and collaborative outcomes in three different tasks, drawing conclusions on how each cue might contribute to these outcomes in a given task and how such relationships generalize across tasks. The resulting models provide a quantitative understanding of the relative importance of each type of social cue in predicting collaborative outcomes, as well as a more thorough understanding of how the role of each social cue changes across tasks. Additionally, our results provide confirmation and illumination of prior findings in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication research.},

Conversations during these tasks are heavily anchored around task objects and their spatial relationships in the real world, making referencing - the ability to refer to an object in a way that is understood by others - a crucial process that warrants explicit support in collaborative Mixed Reality systems. This paper presents a 2x2 mixed factorial experiment that explores the effects of providing spatial information and system-generated guidance to task objects. It also investigates the effects of such guidance on the remote collaborator’s need for spatial information. Our results show that guidance increases performance and communication efficiency while reducing the need for spatial information, especially in unfamiliar environments. Our results also demonstrate a reduced need for remote experts to be in immersive environments, making guidance more scalable, and expertise more accessible.},

abstract = {The definition of "computer graphics" as used by artists in new media and kinetic areas of the arts is much more expansive than simply rendering to a screen. A visit to the SIGGRAPH art gallery, for example, will showcase a wide variety of uses of computing, embedded control, sensors, and actuators in the service of art. Kinetic art using embedded control is a marriage of art and technology. Artistic sensibility and creativity are required for concept and planning, and computer science and engineering skills are required to realize the artistic vision [Candy and Edmonds 2002]. However, these different skills are often taught in extremely different parts of a university campus.As an attempt to bridge this gap, we describe a cross-disciplinary collaborative course that pairs computer science students with art students to engage in joint engineering design and creative studio projects. These projects combine embedded system design with sculpture to create kinetic art. We believe that this is a natural pairing of two disparate disciplines, and one that provides distinct educational benefits to both groups of students [Brunvand and Stout 2011].Kinetic art contains moving parts or depends on motion, sound, or light for its effect. The kinetic aspect is often regulated using micro-controllers connected to motors, actuators, transducers, and sensors that enable the sculpture to move and react to its environment [Malina 1974]. But, distinct from other types of computer art, the computer itself is usually not visible in the artwork. It is a behind the scenes controller. An embedded system is a special-purpose computer system (microcontroller) designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions, often reacting to environmental sensors. It is embedded into a complete device including hardware and mechanical parts rather than being a separate computer system.In the project-based semester-length class we describe in this talk computer science students work together with art students to build collaborative kinetic art pieces. Students explore interfacing of embedded systems with sensors and actuators of all sorts, along with real-time/interactive programming techniques and interrupt driven system design. By requiring that the project groups include both engineers and artists, the students contribute to their own learning and creative growth through peer teaching. Learning to communicate across disciplines, and perhaps just as importantly respect each other's skills and contributions, is vitally important for successful collaboration. The students also explore physical and conceptual aspects of machine-making as a fine-art sculpture process. The resulting artworks often make marks (produce physical "computer graphics") as a part of their artistic function.Our collaborative course builds on the powerful connection between embedded control and kinetic art. This pairing seems like a natural fit, and one with high potential for intriguing results. Engineers are rarely taught to think about artistic, conceptual, and aesthetic outcomes, and artists are not usually taught to think about engineering issues in creating an artistic artifact. The studio model is an intriguing model for more general CS education [Barker et al. 2005], but it is perhaps best experienced in a true studio course. A focus on design thinking also seems to us to be a natural complement to computational thinking.},

abstract = {In the emerging space economy, autonomous robotic missions with specialized goals such as mapping and mining are gaining traction, with agencies and enterprises increasingly investing resources. Multirobot systems (MRS) research has provided many approaches to establish control and communication layers to facilitate collaboration from a technical perspective, such as granting more autonomy to heterogeneous robotic groups through auction-based interactions in mesh networks. However, stakeholders' competing economic interests often prevent them from cooperating within a proprietary ecosystem. Related work suggests that distributed ledger technology (DLT) might serve as a mechanism for enterprises to coordinate workflows and trade services to explore space resources through a transparent, reliable, non-proprietary digital platform. We challenge this perspective by pointing to the core technical weaknesses of block chains, in particular, increased energy consumption, low throughput, and full transparency through redundancy. Our objective is to advance the discussion in a direction where the benefits of DLT from an economic perspective are weighted against the drawbacks from a technical perspective. We finally present a possible DLT-driven heterogeneous MRS for map exploration to study the opportunities for economic collaboration and competitiveness.},

abstract = {The paper describes a toolkit that integrates spatially-aware multi-surface systems with mixed-reality approaches to create immersive collaborative environments. The toolkit integrates multiple digital displays and multiple Microsoft HoloLens devices with multiple Kinects. The HoloLens' allow several users to look at the same virtual hologram while the Kinects enable them to use body movements to interact with these holograms as well as with other digital surfaces in a space. Effectively, the toolkit enables its users to build collaborative applications that utilize digital displays as well as the space between them to interact with information. Our approach also facilitates the management of virtual objects and overcomes gesture restrictions of HoloLens. We use the toolkit in a prototype application for improving the efficiency and response time in emergency management.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud manufacturing service as a new service-oriented manufacturing paradigm, a significant progress has been made in research of different aspects of it. One of the most challenging topics of interest has been service collaboration and optimal selection problem. Since cloud manufacturing service is aiming towards sharing and collaborating among distributed manufacturing resources and services, selecting and collaborating these services to meet the user's requirements while keeping up the optimal service performances is getting higher attention. In this paper, to improve the collaborative manufacturing capability of supply chain enterprises, we propose a collaborating solution and implementation framework based on cloud computing technology, and elaborate the key issues of task decomposition and service matching cloud platform. The collaboration system of the cloud manufacturing for supply chain comprises three modules: cloud computing platform, system coordination processing platform and big data analysis system. This system can provide an important reference for the application of cloud manufacturing service platform in supply chain enterprises.},

Extracting group-level emotional states via facial features, allows us to understand how emotions of a group affect collaboration. To do so, we captured joint emotional state using videos and collaborative experience using questionnaires, from collaborative coding sessions. We define groups' emotional state using a method inspired from dynamic systems, utilizing a measure called cross-recurrence. We also define a collaborative emotional profile using the different measurements from facial features of children. The results show that the emotional cross recurrence (coming from the videos) is positively related with the collaborative experience (coming from the surveys). We also show that the groups with better experience than the others showcase more positive and a consistent set of emotions during the coding activity. The results inform the design of an emotion-aware collaborative support system.},

This study had two parts, both involving bar-coded cards, a bar-code scanner, and a projector. One part emphasized a creative, synthesis-oriented design activity. The other part emphasized a decision-making design activity.We learned that our method of designing the physical cards and the variance in the types of information we included on the cards significantly affected the collaborative behaviors. We also learned that the extension of interactivity from the digital to the physical world and back again successfully scaffolded both creative and decision-making activities in our context, although with some very notable differences in interactive behaviors between the specific activities. This latter point notwithstanding, we learned that allowing high-resolution, small size physical cards to be arrayed and manipulated on a shared surface matters much more for the purposes of scaffolding the collaborative activities than the ability to scan and project large-size, low-resolution facsimiles of the same information, in specific contexts of collaborative story-creation and decision making.},

Therefore, intrusion detection for these IoT devices is crucial. Federated learning, a novel distributed learning approach, which trains multiple clients together and aggregates their weights through a server to achieve collaborative learning. These weights do not disclose the clients' individual dataset information, thereby preserve client privacy while benefiting from the knowledge of other clients. As the intrusion detection datasets for IoT devices come from different domains, the attack categories in these datasets are often highly dissimilar. Therefore, it is necessary to address the Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) nature of the data in federated learning. In this paper, we propose three methods to handle the issues for different numbers of class outputs: maximum value, union, and federated transfer learning.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the consumer market, the unprecedented sensing capability of IoT devices makes it possible to develop advanced sensing and complex inference tasks by leveraging heterogeneous sensors embedded in IoT devices. However, the limited power supply and the restricted computation capability make it challenging to conduct seamless sensing and continuous inference tasks on resource-constrained devices. How to conduct energy-efficient sensing and perform rich-sensor inference tasks on IoT devices is crucial for the success of IoT applications. Therefore, we propose a novel energy-efficient collaborative sensing framework to optimize the energy consumption of IoT devices. Specifically, we explore the latent correlations among heterogeneous sensors via an attention mechanism in temporal convolutional network to quantify the dependency among sensors, and characterize the heterogeneous sensors in terms of energy consumption to categorize them into low-power sensors and energy-intensive sensors. Finally, to decrease the sampling frequency of energy-intensive sensors, we propose a multi-task learning strategy to predict the statuses of energy-intensive sensors based on the low-power sensors. To evaluate the performance of the proposed collaborative sensing framework, we develop a mobile application to collect concurrent heterogeneous data streams from all sensors embedded in Huawei Mate 8. The experimental results show that latent correlation learning is greatly helpful to understand the latent correlations among heterogeneous streams, and it is feasible to predict the statuses of energy-intensive sensors by low-power sensors with high accuracy and fast convergence. In terms of energy consumption, the proposed collaborative sensing framework is able to preserve the energy consumption of IoT devices by nearly 50% for continuous data acquisition tasks.},

A critical factor to the overall utility of Grid is a scalable, flexible and robust registry mechanism. Although it provides some mechanisms to store and access metadata for publishing and discovering resources, such as MCS (Metadata Catalog Service), the Grid registry is inadequate for dealing with domain-specific resources. To enhance the earth science Grid systems, this paper presents a geospatial registry approach in which the OGC (Open GIS Consortium) WRS (Web Registry Service), a &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; standard that supports the publishing of and run-time access to geospatial resources, as a wrapper is used to extend the capabilities of the conventional Grid MCS to the processing of geospatial queries against multiple heterogeneous spatial data sources and services. The approach presented not only focuses on the specifics of descriptive information about spatial data, services, and relevant information objects, but also emphasizes using ontology to infer the semantic relationships between vocabularies for integrating different information models. The implementation of presented approach used in NASA Grid Data Service environment is also illustrated in this paper.},

abstract = {In recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. It is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. This paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. Between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants? normalized learning gain, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. However, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. Because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. Results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. These findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive.},

abstract = {Parallel programming with heterogeneous architectures has gained a reputation for being difficult, but is it really? Modern C++ has come a long way to making parallel programming easier, and the SYCL programming model means heterogeneous programming using C++ is now more accessible than ever. SYCL uses modern standard C++, and it’s a programming model that lets developers support a wide variety of devices (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and more) from a single code base. Given the growing heterogeneity of processor roadmaps, moving to an open standard, platform-independent model (without vendor lock-in) is essential for modern software developers. There are multiple implementations of SYCL available including open source projects, and in this tutorial you will join instructors who are developing some of these alongside experienced developers from academic institutions implementing complex SYCL code bases. This tutorial will provide a way for developers to gain expertise with SYCL in a practical environment focused more on writing code than Powerpoint. Attendees will gain a background of how the designers of the SYCL standard have addressed heterogeneous programming in C++ through industry collaboration. SYCL has gained widespread support in recent years and is available on Exascale systems, desktops, embedded systems, FPGAs, and automotive platforms. Regardless of the particular constructs in the future - the material in this course will prove timeless. This course will start by teaching the fundamentals of heterogeneous parallelism using SYCL. It will also teach you how to make use of modern C++ and the SYCL programming model to build parallel algorithms for heterogeneous devices. Most of the programming focus will be on GPUs, but some time will be spent applying the techniques to simple FPGA examples. The course will teach you how to apply some common GPU optimizations.},

abstract = {Large food-service companies typically support a wide range of operations (catering, vending machines, repairs), each with different operational characteristics (manpower, vehicles, tools, timing constraints, etc.). While the advances in Internet-based technologies facilitate the adoption of automated scheduling systems, the complexity and heterogeneity of the different operations hinders the design of comprehensive optimization solutions. Indeed, our collaboration with Compass Group, one of the largest food-service companies in the world, reveals that many of its workforce assignments are done manually due to the lack of scheduling solutions that can accommodate the complexity of operational constraints. Further, the diversity in the nature of operations prevents collaboration and sharing of resources among various services such as catering and beverage distribution, leading to an inflated fleet size.To address these challenges, we design a unified optimization framework, which can be applied to various food-service operations. Our design combines neighborhood search methods and Linear Programming techniques. We test our framework on real food-service request data from a large Compass Group customer, the Puget-Sound Microsoft Campus. Our results show that our approach scales well while yielding fleet size reductions of around 2x. Further, using our unified framework to simultaneously schedule the operations of two different divisions (catering, water distribution) yields 20% additional savings.},

abstract = {In any collaborative system, there are both symmetries and asymmetries present in the design of the technology and in the ways that technology is appropriated. Yet media space research tends to focus more on supporting and fostering the symmetries than the asymmetries. Throughout more than 20 years of media space research, the pursuit of increased symmetry, whether achieved through technical or social means, has been a recurrent theme. The research literature on the use of contemporary awareness systems, in contrast, displays little if any of this emphasis on symmetrical use; indeed, this body of research occasionally highlights the perceived value of asymmetry. In this paper, we unpack the different forms of asymmetry present in both media spaces and contemporary awareness systems. We argue that just as asymmetry has been demonstrated to have value in contemporary awareness systems, so might asymmetry have value in media spaces and in other CSCW systems, more generally. To illustrate, we present a media space that emphasizes and embodies multiple forms of asymmetry and does so in response to the needs of a particular work context.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth in the world population, developing agricultural technologies has been an urgent need. Sensor networks have been widely used to monitor and manage agricultural status. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are adopted for their high accuracy to enable the analysis of massive data collected through the sensor network. The datasets on the devices of agricultural applications usually need to be completed and bigger, which limits the performance of AI algorithms. Thus, researchers turn to Collaborative Learning (CL) to utilize the data on multiple devices to train a global model privately. However, current CL frameworks for agricultural applications suffer from three problems: data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose cloud-based Collaborative Agricultural Learning with Flexible model size and Adaptive batch number (CALFA) to improve the efficiency and applicability of the training process while maintaining its effectiveness. CALFA contains three modules. The Classification Pyramid allows the devices to use different sizes of models during training and enables the classification of different object sizes. Adaptive Aggregation modifies the aggregation weights to maintain the convergence speed and accuracy. Adaptive Adjustment modifies the training batch numbers to mitigate the communication overhead. The experimental results illustrate that CALFA outperforms other SOTA CL frameworks by reducing up to 75% communication overhead with nearly no accuracy loss. Also, CALFA enables training on more devices by reducing the model size.},

abstract = {Governments of different countries are increasingly expected to work together to address regional and global problems, provide disaster relief, satisfy international agreements, enable trade and movement of people across borders, and, in general, collaborate in achieving mutually-agreed goals. Information technology plays a key role in these transnational collaborations, particularly when country-specific information and IT resources are needed for each and every involved country to play their role in the collaborative efforts. In general, heterogeneity across IT systems is inevitable as it results from differences in economical and technical capabilities across countries, as well as from conceptual differences due to differences in agency missions and their regulatory context (which may, for example, specify what kind of software must be used) and differences in human IT resources. Integration may require use of new and/or existing hardware and/or software at different locations, processing and accessing data located in distinct agencies, and communication among many IT entities. In this context, heterogeneity can lead to several forms of incompatibilities among infrastructures, namely: (1) Hardware incompatibility: when machines do not have the expected architecture or capabilities to run machine-dependent software; (2) Software incompatibility: when needed software components require additional software that is either unavailable or conflicts with software used for local government functions; (3) Communication incompatibility: when multiple software components miss (a) interfaces for communication and (b) commonly understood protocols for communication; (4) Data incompatibility: when data maintained by software components use different organization, structure, semantic and natural language; and (5) Security and accessibility incompatibility: when integrating components with distinct or absent mechanisms for network security and access control.},

Observing that most collected consecutive frames are redundant with few objects of interest (OoIs), the filtering of these frames can dramatically relieve the transmission pressure. Additionally, real-world environment may bring shielding or blind areas in videos, which notoriously affects the accuracy of frame analysis. The collaboration between cameras facing at different angles can compensate for such accuracy loss.In this work, we present Litedge, a light-weight edge computing strategy to improve the QoS (i.e., the latency and accuracy) of wireless surveillance systems. Two main modules are designed on edge cameras: (i) the light-weight video compression module for frame filtering, mainly realized by model compression and convolutional acceleration; and (ii) the collaborative validation module for error compensation between the master-slave camera pair. We also implement an enhanced surveillance system prototype from real-time monitoring and pre-processing on edge cameras to the backend data analysis on a server. Experiments based on real-world collected videos show the efficiency of Litedge. It achieves 82% transmission latency reduction with a maximal 0.119s additional processing delay, compared with the full video transmission. Remarkably, 91.28% of redundant frames are successfully filtered out, greatly reducing the transmission burden. Litedge outperforms state-of-the-art light-weight AI models and video compression methods by balancing the QoS balance ratio between accuracy and latency.},

MarathOn Multiscreen allows users to view, share and curate amateur and professional video footage of a community marathon event. Our investigations focused on collaborative sharing practices across different viewing activities and devices, the roles taken by different devices in a viewing ecology, and observations on how users consume professional and amateur content. Our Work uncovers significant differences in user behaviour and collaboration when engaged in more participatory viewing activities, such as sorting and ranking footage, which has implications for awareness of other users' interactions while viewing together and alone. In addition, user appreciation and use of amateur video content is dependent not only on quality and activity but their personal involvement in the contents.},

abstract = {According to YouTube statistics [1], more than 400 hours of content is uploaded to its platform every minute. At this rate, it is estimated that it would take more than 70 years of continuous watch time in order to view all content on YouTube, assuming no more content is uploaded. This raises great challenges when attempting to actively process and analyze video content.Real-time video processing is a critical element that brings forth numerous applications otherwise infeasible due to scalability constraints. Predictive models are commonly used, specifically Neural Networks (NNs), to accelerate processing time when analyzing realtime content. However, applying NNs is computationally expensive. Advanced hardware (e.g. graphics processing units or GPUs) and cloud infrastructure are usually utilized to meet the demand of processing applications. Nevertheless, recent work in the field of edge computing aims to develop systems that relieve the load on the cloud by delegating parts of the job to edge nodes.Such systems emphasize processing as much as possible within the edge node before delegating the load to the cloud in hopes of reducing the latency. In addition, processing content in the edge promotes the privacy and security of the data. One example is the work by Grulich et al. [2] where the edge node relieves some of the work load off the cloud by splitting, differentiating and compressing the NN used to analyze the content.Even though the collaboration between the edge node and the cloud expedites the processing time by relying on the edge node's capability, there is still room for improvement.Our proposal aims to utilize the edge nodes even further by allowing the nodes to collaborate among themselves as a para-cloud that minimizes the dependency on the primary processing cloud. We propose a collaborative system solution where a video uploaded on an edge node could be labeled and analyzed collaboratively without the need to utilize cloud resources.The proposed collaborative system is illustrated in Figure 1. The system consists of multiple edge nodes that acquire video content from different sources. Each node starts the analysis process via a specialized, smaller NN [3] utilizing the edge node's processing power. Whenever the load overwhelms the node or the node is unable to provide accurate analysis via its specialized NN, the node requests other edge nodes to collaborate on the analysis instead of delegating to the cloud resources. This way the high latency is avoided and other edge node processing power is utilized by splitting the NN among the different edge nodes and distributing the processing load between them.The main contribution of this proposed approach is the alternative conceptualization of collaborative computing: instead of building a system that allows collaboration between edge nodes and the cloud, we explore the prospective of collaboration between edge nodes, minimizing the involvement of the cloud resources even further.},

abstract = {Recently, edge devices such as mobile phones and smartwatches have become part of modern distributed systems, federated learning is an effectively distributed learning paradigm that can leverage these edge devices to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. In federated learning, the device periodically downloads the model from the server, uses the local data for training, and uploads it to the server, while the servers aggregates params uploaded to update the global model. However, different devices are located in different network environments and have different communication and computation capability. Therefore, the model training speed depends on the slowest device, and the system between devices is heterogeneous. To effectively address these problems, we propose to group the devices, firstly use the synchronous method to aggregate model updates within a group, then aggregate updates between groups in an asynchronous way, and propose an algorithm based on weight update to aggregate models. We conduct extensive simulations on our proposed algorithms, and the results show that they can dramatically accelerate model training while achieving high accuracy.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing personalized services for users in the context of information overload. Generally, users’ feedback toward items often contain the most significant information reflecting their preferences, which enables accurate personalized recommendation. In real applications, users’ feedback are usually heterogeneous (rather than homogeneous) such as purchases and examinations in e-commerce, which reflects users’ preferences in different degrees. Effective modeling of such heterogeneous one-class feedback is challenging compared with that of homogeneous feedback of ratings. As a response, heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) is proposed, which often converts the heterogeneous feedback into two parts (i.e., target feedback and auxiliary feedback), aiming to care more about the target feedback (e.g., purchases) with the assistance of the auxiliary feedback (e.g., examinations). In this survey, we provide an overview of the representative HOCCF methods from the perspective of factorization-based methods, transfer learning-based methods, and deep learning-based methods. First, we review the factorization-based methods according to different strategies. Second, we describe the transfer learning-based methods with different knowledge sharing manners. Third, we discuss the deep learning-based methods according to the neural architectures. Moreover, we include some important example applications, describe the empirical studies, and discuss some promising future directions.},

We draw insights from 12 learning sessions with Torino that involved five pairs of children with vision ranging from blindness to full-sight. Our findings show how sense-making of the technology, collaboration, and learning were enabled through an interplay of system design, programing tasks and social interactions, and how this differed between the pairs.

While existing techniques focus on either mining alert patterns or filtering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider the two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and better understand abnormal system behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a collaborative alert ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content correlations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a hierarchical Bayesian model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in each alert sequence. Then, an entity embedding-based model is proposed to learn the content correlations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes. Finally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into a unified optimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert patterns. Our experiments-using both synthetic and real-world enterprise security alert data-show that CAR can accurately identify true positive alerts and successfully reconstruct the attack scenarios at the same time.},

abstract = {Interactive 3D content gains increasing use in VR/AR applications in different domains, such as education, training, engineering, spatial and urban planning as well as architectural and interior design. While modeling and presenting interactive 3D scenes in collaborative VR/AR environments, different 3D objects are added, modified and removed by different users, which leads to the evolution of the scenes over time. Representation of VR content covering temporal knowledge is essential to enable exploration of such time-dependent VR/AR content. However, the available approaches do not enable exploration of VR content with regards to its time-dependent components and properties, which limits their usage in web-based systems. The main contribution of this paper is 4--dimensional representation of VR content, which encompasses time being the fourth dimension. The representation is based on the semantic web standards and ontologies, which enable the use of domain knowledge for collaborative creation and exploration of content. This could improve the availability of VR/AR applications to domain specialists without expertise in 3D graphics and animation, thus improving the overall dissemination of VR/AR on the web. The representation has been implemented in a heterogeneous collaborative VR environment for urban design.},

abstract = {Computer-supported Supply Chain Management (SCM) has helped business partners to significantly improve their cooperation and collaboration along the product lifecycle. There is plenty of reported evidence that suggest inter-firm SCM have helped speed up the cycle time and reduce logistics inefficiencies. However, even with the significant improvement in Internet-driven and inter-firm SCM technologies for supporting make-to-order production, it is not always possible to satisfy the Available-to-Promise (ATP) and Capable-to-Promise (CTP) requirements. This is typically due to the untimely and unmatched production capacity to customer demand leading to dissatisfaction from the customers and the suppliers. We describe a multi-agent-based architecture for automated multi-attribute negotiation in order promising to help search for new solutions until a satisfactory solution is found. We embed multi-attribute multi-utility simulations into a linear program to search for a negotiated solutions when a typical ATP/CTP function of a supply chain management system forces a rejection of a customer order.},

abstract = {Embedded computing devices increasingly permeate many aspects of modern life: from medical to automotive, from building and factory automation to weapons, from avionics to home entertainment. Despite their specialized nature as well as limited resources and connectivity, these devices are becoming an increasingly popular and attractive target for remote malware infestation attacks, exemplified by Stuxnet [1]. Many mitigation techniques have been proposed, varying in terms of generality and underlying assumptions. One common theme is the need for Remote Attestation, a distinct security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to check the internal state of a remote untrusted embedded device (prover). Purely software-based techniques, while efficient, offer dubious security guarantees. Most hardware-based techniques are too costly for low-end embedded devices.This talk focuses on three important challenges in designing Remote Attestation techniques for low-end embedded devices. First, what is the minimal set of hardware and software features for a low-end embedded device to attain provably secure remote attestation, under the strongest possible and realistic adversary model? Second, what mechanisms and features are needed to protect the remote attestation process from unauthorized invocation, i.e., how to assure that an embedded device is not being misused? Third, how to design efficient remote attestation for a multitude of potentially heterogeneous embedded devices, e.g., within a vehicle, a household, or an aircraft? Some of this research [2-4] was conducted in collaboration with K. Eldefrawy, A. Francillon, D. Perito and K. Rasmussen.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous information network has been widely used to alleviate sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems since it can model rich context information in user-item interactions. Graph neural network is able to encode this rich context information through propagation on the graph. However, existing heterogeneous graph neural networks neglect entanglement of the latent factors stemming from different aspects. Moreover, meta paths in existing approaches are simplified as connecting paths or side information between node pairs, overlooking the rich semantic information in the paths. In this paper, we propose a novel disentangled heterogeneous graph attention network DisenHAN for top-N recommendation, which learns disentangled user/item representations from different aspects in a heterogeneous information network. In particular, we use meta relations to decompose high-order connectivity between node pairs and propose a disentangled embedding propagation layer which can iteratively identify the major aspect of meta relations. Our model aggregates corresponding aspect features from each meta relation for the target user/item. With different layers of embedding propagation, DisenHAN is able to explicitly capture the collaborative filtering effect semantically. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that DisenHAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We further demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the learned disentangled representations via insightful case studies and visualization.},

abstract = {US Customs has recently embarked on a major modernization initiative of its Information Technology systems. Drawing in data from Customs trade systems, targeting inspectors review manifest information as well as strategic and tactical intelligence to determine which shipments and containers are "high-risk." This entails a considerable level of communication and data sharing between various government agencies. Our NSF funded project, funded through the digital government program, aims at providing decision makers with the ability to extract and fuse information from multiple, heterogeneous sources in response to a query while operating under a decentralized security administration. Based on the idea of "Smart Borders", the system will utilize data available from different agencies, ports and customs divisions to supplement the profiling by targeting towards anomalies, and detect various flags raised by non-conforming shipments or abnormal behavior of inbound cargos and raise a combination of alerts. This project proposes generalizable development work, which devises solutions to accomplish secure interoperation among different government agencies. The output of this project would ideally enhance the security aspect of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) system by incorporating the concept of semantic interoperability, anomaly detection and subsequent spatial and geographical visualization of information that can help Customs inspectors make better decisions. This project is a collaboration between the industry, government and the academia, providing the opportunity to directly influence the practical needs of the government agency, in this case the US Customs.},

abstract = {The increasing number of software-based attacks has attracted substantial efforts to prevent applications from malicious interference. For example, Trusted Computing (TC) technologies have been recently proposed to provide strong isolation on application platforms. On the other hand, today pervasively available computing cycles and data resources have enabled various distributed applications that require collaboration among different application processes. These two conflicting trends grow in parallel. While much existing research focuses on one of these two aspects, a few authors have considered simultaneously providing strong isolation as well as collaboration convenience, particularly in the TC environment. However, none of these schemes is transparent. That is, they require modifications either of legacy applications or the underlying Operating System (OS).In this paper, we propose the SecureBus (SB) architecture, aiming to provide strong isolation and flexible controlled information flow and communication between processes at runtime. Since SB is application and OS transparent, existing applications can run without changes to commodity OS's. Furthermore, SB enables the enforcement of general access control policies, which is required but difficult to achieve for typical legacy applications. To study its feasibility and performance overhead, we have implemented a prototype system based on User-Mode Linux. Our experimental results show that SB can effectively achieve its design goals.},

abstract = {Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various cooperative work settings. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how decision-makers collaborate with imperfect AI by investigating appropriate reliance and task performance with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Several human-centered explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in hopes of improving decision-makers' collaboration with AI; however, these techniques are grounded in findings from previous studies that primarily focus on the impact of incorrect AI advice. Few studies acknowledge the possibility of the explanations being incorrect even if the AI advice is correct. Thus, it is crucial to understand how imperfect XAI affects human-AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how incorrect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird species identification task, taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the influence of imperfect XAI and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI and human-AI team performance. We also discuss how explanations can deceive decision-makers during human-AI collaboration. Hence, we shed light on the impacts of imperfect XAI in the field of computer-supported cooperative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.},

abstract = {This contribution deals with an approach to ontology-based integration of Decision Support Systems for Structural Health Monitoring, specifically the implementation of a damage detection strategy for identifying and localizing damages to (civil) infrastructure (e.g., bridges, piping systems or wind turbines). Different institutions operate a large variety of systems for measurement planning, recording and analysis and each of these systems has its advantages and disadvantages depending, for instance, on the type of structure to be monitored. To combine the advantages of such heterogeneous systems, computer-supported collaboration is useful, which leads each institution to consider developing its own domain ontology. This knowledge can be integrated by means of a higher-level ontology to use different operations and approaches together for cumulative advantages. Hence, a concept for ontology-based integration building upon ideas of semantic data integration was developed, which stands out from other approaches as it uses a single ontology as its meta-vocabulary and a mediator-driven architecture.},

abstract = {Usage data captured and logged by computers has long been an essential source of information for software developers, support services personnel, usability designers, and learning researchers [1, 2]. Whether from mainframes, file servers, network devices, or workstations, the user event data logged in its many forms has served as an essential source of information for those who need to improve software, analyze problems, monitor security, track workflow, report on resource usage, evaluate learning activities etc. With today's generation of open and community source web-based frameworks, however, new challenges arise as to how, where, and when user activity gets captured and analyzed. These frameworks' flexibility in allowing easy integration of different applications, presentation technologies, middleware, and data sources has side effects on usage data: fragmented logs in a wide range of formats often bestrewn across many locations.This paper focuses on common issues faced especially by academic computing support personnel who need to gather and analyze user activity information within heterogeneous, distributed open source web frameworks like Sakai and uPortal. As described in this paper, these kinds of challenges can be met by drawing upon techniques for coordinated distributed event monitoring along with some basic data mining and data visualization approaches. In particular, this paper describes a work-in-progress to develop an approach towards building a distributed capture and analysis systems for a large production deployment of the Sakai Collaboration and Learning Environment in order to meet a wide range of tracking, monitoring, and reporting log analysis in one university setting.},

Drawing in data from Customs trade systems, targeting inspectors review manifest information as well as strategic and tactical intelligence to determine which shipments and containers are "high-risk." This entails a considerable level of communication and data sharing between various government agencies. Our NSF funded project, funded through the digital government program, aims at providing decision makers with the ability to extract and fuse information from multiple, heterogeneous sources in response to a query while operating under a decentralized security administration. Based on the idea of "Smart Borders", the system will utilize data available from different agencies, ports and customs divisions to supplement the profiling by targeting towards anomalies, and detect various flags raised by non-conforming shipments or abnormal behavior of inbound cargos and raise a combination of alerts. This project proposes generalizable development work, which devises solutions to accomplish secure interoperation among different government agencies. The output of this project would ideally enhance the security aspect of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) system by incorporating the concept of semantic interoperability, anomaly detection and subsequent spatial and geographical visualization of information that can help Customs inspectors make better decisions. This project is a collaboration between the industry, government and the academia, providing the opportunity to directly influence the practical needs of the government agency, in this case the US Customs.},

abstract = {The development of Next-Generation Sequencing, or NGS, has heightened the throughput of traditional sequencing by using RNA reads to work backward, assembling a transcriptome from expressed fragments. These methods are designed to lower the cost of DNA sequencing by analyzing vast quantities of RNA fragments but have led to computational and storage obstacles. RNA sequencing produces large files that can be in excess of 20GB, making them unwieldy to the general researcher. Vast data resources have been created to extract the information contained in these massively parallel data. These resources and their associated tools are heterogeneous and highly distributed. This requires the scientist to create and execute highly complex customized analyses that involve gathering and organizing data from heterogeneous sources while interfacing with a variety of software tools. This is often infeasible without the support of computer specialists and significant hardware upgrades.The objective of this work is to combine the strengths of the scientific workflow project, Galaxy, with traditional high performance computing resources and affordable cloud-based data storage that encourages collaboration. The specific goals are to create a Galaxy tool that executes Trinity on a remote cluster and to develop software to download, upload, and manage NGS results to and from the cloud. Trinity is a computationally expensive de novo assembler that processes large RNA files to produce a FASTA transcriptome. Our system facilitates broad-based collaboration and distribution by building around the Google Drive cloud storage solution, where the processing of RNA sequences can be both shared and analyzed with a single upload and be reused for multiple purposes. The system is also able to remotely execute Trinity and other NGS tools on traditional high performance computing infrastructure that is often available as a shared resource at universities. Specifically, we develop a Trinity-based workflow executed in a heterogeneous environment with batch HPC resources that produce the abundances' of RNA fragments to discover patterns of expression.To demonstrate our workflow system with cloud-based storage and sharing, we will analyze duplicate samples of ovarian biopsies that have been generated by 72 base, paired-end sequencing (RNAseq) performed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIX. Sequencing was performed utilizing a balanced block design with pooled barcoded samples from 8 fish run in each lane and duplicate lanes employed as sequencing technical replicates. As the Illumina-based RNAseq approach exhibits much higher sensitivity for low abundance transcripts and far deeper sequencing coverage than the Roche 454 pyro-sequencing originally utilized, we expect that thousands of new ovarian gene transcripts will be revealed by this approach after RNAseq reads are quality filtered, assembled de novo into contigs and compared to the existing striped bass ovarian transcriptome, and especially to the tens of thousands of singleton sequences that we obtained but have not previously verified or published. This process will yield a far more comprehensive ovarian transciptome that will represent the overwhelming majority of genes expressed in the ovary of striped bass during oocyte growth and maturation.},

abstract = {To develop systems effectively, a shared system understanding is required. Collaborative modeling is one way to capture this shared understanding. Increasingly, in large systems engineering projects different distances lead to social barriers between stakeholders. These barriers affect the quantity and quality of knowledge that is shared between stakeholders, thus reducing the quality of the resulting product. While it has been proposed to limit modeling activities to co-located teams, this might not always be possible or feasible. We argue that, despite the technological advances in collaborative modeling, effective collaboration can only be achieved if we understand how to account for social barriers. We propose to study, in depth, how these barriers affect modeling, and how their effects can be reduced. By understanding the effects of social barriers and accounting for them, we can maximize the benefits of collaborative modeling.},

We evaluate the impact of this approach on single and repeated use of collaborative MR systems for remote guidance through a comparative study. Our results indicate that despite having a limited understanding of the novice’s environment, using an UnMapped interface increased performance and communication efficiency while reducing experts’ task load. We also outline the various affordances of providing remote experts with a familiar and spatially-stable environment to assist novices.},

abstract = {With limited battery supply, power is a scarce commodity in wireless sensor networks. Thus, to prolong the lifetime of the network, it is imperative that the sensor resources are managed effectively. This task is particularly challenging in heterogeneous sensor networks for which decisions and compromises regarding sensing strategies are to be made under time and resource constraints. In such networks, a sensor has to reason about its current state to take actions that are deemed appropriate with respect to its mission, its energy reserve, and the survivability of the overall network. Sensor Management controls and coordinates the use of the sensory suites in a manner that maximizes the success rate of the system in achieving its missions. This article focuses on formulating and developing an autonomous energy-aware sensor management system that strives to achieve network objectives while maximizing its lifetime. A team-theoretic formulation based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model and the Joint Intention theory is proposed as a mechanism for effective and energy-aware collaborative decision-making. The proposed system models the collective behavior of the sensor nodes using the Joint Intention theory to enhance sensors’ collaboration and success rate. Moreover, the BDI modeling of the sensor operation and reasoning allows a sensor node to adapt to the environment dynamics, situation-criticality level, and availability of its own resources. The simulation scenario selected in this work is the surveillance of the Waterloo International Airport. Various experiments are conducted to investigate the effect of varying the network size, number of threats, threat agility, environment dynamism, as well as tracking quality and energy consumption, on the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach compared to the state-of-the-art centralized approach adapted from Atia et al. [2011] and the localized approach in Hilal and Basir [2015] in terms of energy consumption, adaptability, and network lifetime. The results show that the proposed approach has 12 \texttimes{} less energy consumption than that of the popular centralized approach.},

To understand how this "natural product evolution" happens, we have conducted a case study of four typical OSS projects. Unlike most previous studies on software evolution that focus on the evolution of the system per se, our study takes a broader perspective: It examines not only the evolution of OSS systems, but also the evolution of the associated OSS communities, as well as the relationship between the two types of evolution.Through the case study, we have found that while collaborative development within a community is the essential characteristic of OSS, different collaboration models exist, and that the difference in collaboration model results in different evolution patterns of OSS systems and communities. To treat such differences systematically, we propose to classify OSS into three types: Exploration-Oriented, Utility-Oriented, and Service-Oriented. Such a classification can provide guidance on the creation and maintenance of sustainable OSS development and communities.},

The local display device may render all, some or none of the data set remotely, depending on its available resources. This enables scientists and engineers to collaborate from their desks, in the field or in front of specialised immersive displays. We present initial results of our implementation, showing how we distribute complete datasets across multiple machines as required, using a central data service to distribute data updates from collaborating users. We will demonstrate RAVE at SC2004, utilising available heterogeneous resources.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are widely used in recommender system research due to their ability to model complex auxiliary information beyond historical interactions to alleviate data sparsity problem. Existing HIN-based recommendation studies have achieved great success via performing graph convolution operators between pairs of nodes on predefined metapath induced graphs, but they have the following major limitations. First, existing heterogeneous network construction strategies tend to exploit item attributes while failing to effectively model user relations. In addition, previous HIN-based recommendation models mainly convert heterogeneous graph into homogeneous graphs by defining metapaths ignoring the complicated relation dependency involved on the metapath. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel recommendation model with two-way metapath encoder for top-N recommendation, which models metapath similarity and sequence relation dependency in HIN to learn node representations. Specifically, our model first learns the initial node representation through a pre-training module, and then identifies potential friends and item relations based on their similarity to construct a unified HIN. We then develop the two-way encoder module with similarity encoder and instance encoder to capture the similarity collaborative signals and relational dependency on different metapaths. Finally, the representations on different meta-paths are aggregated through the attention fusion layer to yield rich representations. Extensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {As a promising approach to end-user computing, programming by demonstration (PBD) techniques have been explored by many researchers in single-user applications. This paper investigates how PBD techniques can be used to support end-user customization of groupware tools. In collaborative applications, complex semantic relationships can emerge unanticipatedly among objects (participants, data artifacts, tools, devices, etc.) such as the hierarchical organization of participants, consistency maintenance among different views of the same data, and awareness control. It is important that end users are empowered to customize the groupware application to model and enforce such relationships. We present an active rule based approach to modeling user-defined semantic relationships in collaborative applications and explore a demonstrational approach for end-user customization of collaboration tools to support the definition of those relationships. The presented work is based on our work on a shared whiteboard tool, CAB or Collaborative Active whiteBoard. Our approach is being generalized to support end user defined object relationships in shared workspaces.},

title = {3rd Annual Workshop on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH)},
year = {2011},
publisher = {IBM Corp.},
address = {USA},
abstract = {In May 2011 the Health Council of Canada released its second report on the state of healthcare renewal in Canada. Although the report identified that significant progress had been made in several areas since the previous report in 2008, the 2011 report still described the need for more work to ensure that our healthcare system will evolve and be sustainable for the years to come. One particular challenge is the need to integrate services over an expanding continuum of providers, services and illnesses. Healthcare delivery is becoming increasingly complex as it shifts from care provided by a single provider or setting and towards a collaborative care supplied by multiple providers across multiple settings. For example, patients with chronic illness frequently move between inpatient and outpatient settings and require collaboration by physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals who act as an integrated network across hospital and community settings. Another highlighted challenge was the need for performance measurement of healthcare delivery by establishing meaningful targets and measurable goals to enable healthcare delivery is driven by good management practices.In light of the above challenges to healthcare delivery, it can be argued that the fundamental challenge our healthcare system faces is one of connectivity. Successful healthcare interoperability will be dependent upon our ability to connect people, processes, data, policies and procedures, as well as the need to connect outcomes to system objectives through performance management. In our previous two workshops on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH) we emphasized that the fundamental challenges facing interoperability are not technical but are rather process, people or evaluation issues. It is important that we do not define interoperability as the ends but rather as a means for achieving core health system objectives such as efficient, effective and timely delivery of patient centered healthcare. Subsequently we should not evaluate interoperability efforts solely by our ability to connect disparate computer systems but rather by our abilities to achieve health system objectives. However to effectively evaluate healthcare delivery we need to develop and implement business analytic solutions to enable timely evaluation of healthcare delivery.As we move towards digital solutions such as electronic health records to enhance healthcare delivery, our goal should not be to simply automate existing healthcare processes such as group decision making or communication. Rather our goal should be to leverage smart interactions and technologies to enable processes that go beyond how healthcare delivery is currently provided. Healthcare is a complex, dynamic and exception laden domain. Smart interactions and mobile technologies provide us the tools to support the dynamic nature of healthcare delivery that enable us to support meaningful interoperability. For example, the management of diabetes requires medical registries to track patients over time and to communicate guidelines for ongoing clinical management. Meaningful interoperability can also enable performance management solutions to ensure we provide timely, efficient and patient-centered care delivery. However, the development of technologies to support meaningful interoperability faces significant challenges such as obtaining consistent, timely and quality data in a secure manner in order to facilitate performance-managed driven healthcare delivery. We also caution that an uncoordinated approach to the design and implementation of smart interactions and other information technology will only create barriers to accessibility and integration. It will also burden healthcare providers with administration and information overload that falls short of delivering real benefits.To facilitate meaningful interoperability we needed to first understand the underlying complexity of healthcare interoperability by developing models and frameworks that enable us to effectively leverage Web 2.0 tools and other Smart technologies to support healthcare delivery. This workshop was presented and coordinated by a select group of health informatics and software engineering researchers, and practitioners from across Canada and built upon our previous two workshops with the theme of going beyond basic healthcare interoperability. Our workshop emphasized the need to develop healthcare interoperability solutions using an interdisciplinary perspective. ISIH workshops have been well attended by a mix of health care administrators, practitioners and representatives from standards body's initiatives, as well as academic researchers and industry partners. The workshop focused on developing an agenda for meaningful interoperability.The following questions were posed: How can business analytics and care flow process modeling be effectively combined to improve health care delivery (i.e. achieve smart interactions)? What are the current interoperability barriers that need to be overcome in order to achieve meaningful interoperability using smart interactions?The focus was on presenting case studies and anecdotes to illustrate the issues and potential solutions as a starting point for brainstorming as well as research initiatives that can generalize a systematic approach to these issues. The core of the workshop focused on a panel discussion and brainstorming around the question about whether electronic health records initiatives and Health 2.0 are in conflict or consensus. Are they diametrically opposed approaches to the problem with inherently different philosophies and approaches? Or do they represent complementary approaches tackling different aspects of the same problem in which both would be required for a solution? The workshop opened with short presentations from the panel members who provided background and outlined their basic position. They also recounted actual experiences or academic results related to the questions.The second half was devoted to an interactive discussion in which the presenters debated different aspects of the problem in response to questions from the audience. The closing portion was reserved for general brainstorming guided by the moderators into a discussion of potential next steps and an action plan for collaboration and further exchanges of ideas beyond the end of the workshop. The panel presentations discussed the promises, challenges and risks of federated electronic health record system infrastructures and how we could devise Health 2.0 technologies to provide smarter interactions between health care providers and health care consumers (the patients).The workshop concluded with a summation of interoperability issues in health care and a chance to form collaborative partnerships between the workshop participants. The overall objective was to foster brainstorming sessions and continue the collaboration spawned at ISIH 2009 and ISIH 2010 in the areas of academic and industry efforts to adopt standards, technology and processes related to electronic health records.},

abstract = {We present a framework for collaborative image analysis where gaze information is shared across all users. A server gathers and broadcasts fixation data from/to all clients and the clients visualize this information. Several visualization options are provided. The system can run in real-time or gaze information can be recorded and shared the next time an image is accessed. Our framework is scalable to large numbers of clients with different eye tracking devices. To evaluate our system we used it within the context of a spot-the-differences game. Subjects were presented with 10 image pairs each containing 5 differences. They were given one minute to detect the differences in each image. Our study was divided into three sessions. In session 1, subjects completed the task individually, in session 2, pairs of subjects completed the task without gaze sharing, and in session 3, pairs of subjects completed the task with gaze sharing. We measured accuracy, time-to-completion and visual coverage over each image to evaluate the performance of subjects in each session. We found that visualizing shared gaze information by graying out previously scrutinized regions of an image significantly increases the dwell time in the areas of the images that are relevant to the task (i.e. the regions where differences actually occurred). Furthermore, accuracy and time-to-completion also improved over collaboration without gaze sharing though the effects were not significant. Our framework is useful for a wide range of image analysis applications which can benefit from a collaborative approach.},

abstract = {Telepointers are a real-time collaborative feature to indicate pointing at shared objects. Existing telepointing techniques are, however, restricted to pointing at the foremost object underneath a mouse cursor in relaxed-space but strict-time WYSIWIS environments. In real-time collaborative 3D design systems with animation creation capabilities, multiple 3D objects can be simultaneously visible underneath mouse cursors for users to freely and concurrently work on and point at (unconstrained collaboration), and multiple users can view 3D workspaces and point from different viewing perspectives (relaxed-space WYSIWIS) and animation time frames (relaxed-time WYSIWIS). This paper contributes a novel XPointer technique with the capability of pointing through objects correctly and consistently from different viewing perspectives and time frames, even in the presence of concurrent editing work. This work is the first to identify and address these advanced 3D telepointing needs and capabilities, and to extend the concept of relaxed WYSIWIS to include the time aspect. The XPointer has been implemented in the CoMaya real-time collaborative 3D design system (demonstration video: http://cooffice.ntu.edu.sg/comaya/videoXPointer.php).},

However, it remains unclear how the modality of breath signals (visual, haptic) is socially interpreted during collaborative tasks. In this mixed-methods study, we design and evaluate BreatheWithMe, a prototype for real-time sharing and receiving of breathing signals through visual, vibrotactile, or visual-vibrotactile modalities. In a within-subjects study (15 pairs), we investigated the effects of modality on breathing synchrony, social presence, and overall user experience. Key findings showed: (a) there were no significant effects of visualization modality on breathing synchrony, only on deliberate music-driven synchronization; (b) visual modality was preferred over vibrotactile feedback, despite no differences across social presence dimensions; (c) BreatheWithMe was perceived to be an insightful window into others, however included data exposure and social acceptability concerns. We contribute insights into the design of multi-modal real-time breathing visualization systems for colocated, collaborative tasks.},

At present, many CTC technologies have been proposed. However, there are few high throughput CTC works from ZigBee to WiFi. Our approach, called ZiFi, is a novel CTC framework that lightweight enough to convey data from ZigBee to WiFi. The key idea of ZiFi is to modulate symbol message by leveraging change of the ZigBee packets power. At the receiver side, WiFi device senses RSS value and recognizes ZigBee signal energy pattern to decode transmitted symbols. We finally implement and evaluate ZiFi on commodity WiFi and ZigBee devices. Our results show that it is feasible to use RSS of ZigBee packets and ZiFi can achieve a throughput rate of 297.1bps (the latest packet-level CTC method is 215.9bps). Here we demonstrate using ZiFi on a laptop to receive temperature data from a ZigBee node.},

As AR interfaces project digital data, information and models into the real world, it allows for new forms of collaborative work.

This paper presents a study which examines how a mobile AR (M-AR) interface for inspecting and discovering AR models of varying complexity impacts co-located group practices. We contribute new insights into how current mobile AR interfaces impact co-located collaboration. Our results show that M-AR interfaces induce high mental load and frustration, cause a high number of context switches between devices and group discussion, and overall leads to a reduction in group interaction.

abstract = {Hybrid Collaboration, where remote and co-located team members work together using different devices and tools, has already been trending in recent years (e.g., through globalization and international cooperation) but experienced a further boost since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason behind this surge in hybrid practices is probably that the crisis revealed aspects of remote collaboration which proved functional and which many decision makers (in industry as well as academia) plan to retain for the future. Thus, hybrid collaboration is an extremely timely topic which should be further studied in the context of CSCW. One major CSCW-anchored concept that has most intensively been researched in co-located collaboration settings where it is usually inherently related to spatial aspects and proximity, is territoriality. Already work on territoriality in fully distributed, remote settings has shown that there are significant differences due to the characteristics of the scenario. In this paper, we focus on territoriality in hybrid settings where we identified a significant research gap, and present the results of a user study with 22 teams consisting of four people each (distributed across two locations at two different universities), collaborating on a problem-solving task. Our findings reveal that more dimensions and communication channels, in addition to space, might strongly impact territoriality and territorial behavior in hybrid collaboration. Besides classical spatial territories also auditory territories frequently emerged. In addition, visibility of and accessibility to certain territories need to be rethought. We discuss these novel findings also regarding their interplay with earlier ones and derive design implications for CSCW systems supporting hybrid collaboration.},

abstract = {Collaborative annotation reduces the time and cost of the annotation task and increases data quality. For knowledge-intensive contexts, collaborative annotation is an interesting approach to combine expert users’ knowledge with domain data. This work was motivated by a use case where expert users’ tacit knowledge associated with externalized data can produce new domain knowledge. That new knowledge can inform AI-based systems and make them more accurate for that specific domain. To identify and understand the collaborative annotation process’ dimensions, especially when the annotation is used to support AI models, we defined the following research question: “What are the methods, tools, and solutions to allow collaborative annotation?”. We did a systematic literature review, using five specific questions to help us answer the main research question. Our findings allowed us to identify different domains that adopt this approach, tools for collaborative annotation, players present in the process, and strategies for collaborative annotation. We summarize the findings in a taxonomy to represent aspects related to the characterization of annotation, the collaboration itself, and user experience strategies to support this process. We conclude the paper suggesting open opportunities for future research and implications for the design of an AI-based system to support experts in knowledge-intensive processes.},

The interplay between the digitisation of food aid, within the socio-technical context of refugees, and community collaborative practices is yet to be investigated. Through design engagements and interviews with refugees and shop owners we explore the experiences of a Syrian refugee community in Lebanon using the e-voucher system. We provide insights into the socio-technical environment in which the e-voucher system is dispensing aid, the information and power asymmetries experienced, refugee collaborative coping practices and how they interplay with the e-voucher system. We highlight the need for: (1) expanding refugee digital capabilities to encompass understandings of aid technologies and identifying trusted intermediaries and (2) for technologies to support in upholding humanitarian principles and mitigating power and information asymmetries. Lastly, we call for CSCW researchers and humanitarian innovators to consider how humanitarian technologies can enable refugee collaborative practices and adopt everyday security as a lens for designing aid technologies. The paper contributes to CSCW knowledge regarding the interplay between aid technologies and refugees? socio-technical contexts and practices that provides a basis for future technological designs for collaborative technologies for refugee food security.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the integration of a large number of autonomous heterogeneous devices that report information from the physical environment to the monitoring system for analytics and meaningful decisions. The compromised machines in the IoT network may not only be used for spreading unwanted content such as spam, malware, viruses etc, but can also report incorrect information about the physical world that might have a disastrous consequence. The challenge is to design a collaborative reputation system that calculates trustworthiness of machines in the IoT-based machine-to-machine network without consuming high system resources and breaching the privacy of participants. To address the challenge of privacy preserving reputation system for the decentralized IoT environment, this paper presents a novel M2M-REP (Machine to Machine Reputation) system that computes global reputation of the machine by aggregating the encrypted local feedback provided by machines in a fully decentralized and secure way. The privacy of participating machines is well protected such that machines or analyst would not learn any information about the feedback score provided by the participating machines other than the final aggregated statistical score. We present a decentralized reputation aggregation system for two scenarios: a semi-honest (honest-but-curious) setup where machines are trustworthy in providing feedback but are curious to learn sensitive information about the collaborating machines, and the malicious model where machines not only try to learn the sensitive information of participants but also do not follow the protocol specification in providing feedback. We analyzed the security and privacy properties of the M2M-REP system for different adversarial models.},

abstract = {Designing a new drug is a lengthy and expensive process. As the space of potential molecules is very large (10 23 - 10 60 ), a common technique during drug discovery is to start from a molecule which already has some of the desired properties. An interdisciplinary team of scientists generates hypothesis about the required changes to the prototype. In this work, we develop an algorithmic unsupervised-approach that automatically generates potential drug molecules given a prototype drug. We show that the molecules generated by the system are valid molecules and significantly different from the prototype drug. Out of the compounds generated by the system, we identified 35 FDA-approved drugs. As an example, our system generated Isoniazid - one of the main drugs for Tuberculosis. The system is currently being deployed for use in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies to further analyze the additional generated molecules.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a framework for supporting interoperation between access control systems of different organizations in a collaborative environment. We assume that each organization regulates access to resources using the role based access control (RBAC) model. We define the scope of collaboration as the set of shared resources, of shared operations that those resources can execute, and of roles that can execute those operations. We address collaborative scenarios in which the scope of collaboration changes based on autonomous sharing policies of each organization. We assume that resources are mobile and that their operations can be executed only at the location in which they reside. Our framework supports queries about location of resources, of operations that those resources can execute, and of access rights that allow the execution of those operations. In order to support this type of queries, the RBAC policies of the collaborating organizations are integrated into a global RBAC policy that acts as a mediator. Our framework uses the Web Ontology Language (OWL) to represent: 1) the global RBAC policy; 2) the local RBAC policies belonging to different organizations; and 3) relationships between the global and local RBAC policies.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of VR and a metaverse on the horizon, many multi-user activities are migrating to the VR world, calling for effective collaboration support. As one key feature, traditional collaborative systems provide users with undo mechanics to reverse errors and other unwanted changes. While undo has been extensively researched in this domain and is now considered industry standard, it is strikingly absent for VR systems in research and industry. This work addresses this research gap by exploring different undo techniques for basic object manipulation in different collaboration modes in VR. We conducted a study involving 32 participants organized in teams of two. Here, we studied users’ performance and preferences in a tower stacking task, varying the available undo techniques and their mode of collaboration. The results suggest that users desire and use undo in VR and that the choice of the undo technique impacts users’ performance and social connection.},

Thus, especially in complex software projects, risks and inconsistencies are easily overlooked. In this paper, we present the concept of an Augmented Interaction Room (AugIR), i.e. a physical team room whose walls are outfitted with wall-sized touchscreens that visualize different aspects of a software system in the form of various model sketches. These sketches can be annotated by the stakeholders in order to explicitly mark important elements or indicate aspects that are critical for project success. The AugIR strives to support the collaborative work of heterogeneous teams and especially targets the inclusion of non-technical stakeholders into the communication process. Therefore, the AugIR continuously monitors the stakeholders’ design and modeling activities and analyzes the relationships between annotated contents to automatically uncover inconsistencies, contradictions and hidden potential project risks.},

In our approach, images of a person are captured from all around using multiple cameras, transmitted through a network, and displayed on a revolving flat panel display that is capable of presenting different images according to the orientation of the viewing position; the revolving display presents each image so that it is visible exclusively at the orientation from which it was taken, and consequently, an image of the person that can be viewed from various directions is realized. Through the implementation of the prototype system and experiments, it was confirmed that the proposed approach is feasible and that the prototype system functions effectively.},

abstract = {Visual slide-based presentations are ubiquitous, yet slide authoring tools are largely inaccessible to people who are blind or visually impaired (BVI). When authoring presentations, the 9 BVI presenters in our formative study usually work with sighted collaborators to produce visual slides based on the text content they produce. While BVI presenters valued collaborators’ visual design skill, the collaborators often felt they could not fully review and provide feedback on the visual changes that were made. We present Diffscriber, a system that identifies and describes changes to a slide’s content, layout, and style for presentation authoring. Using our system, BVI presentation authors can efficiently review changes to their presentation by navigating either a summary of high-level changes or individual slide elements. To learn more about changes of interest, presenters can use a generated change hierarchy to navigate to lower-level change details and element styles. BVI presenters using Diffscriber were able to identify slide design changes and provide feedback more easily as compared to using only the slides alone. More broadly, Diffscriber illustrates how advances in detecting and describing visual differences can improve mixed-ability collaboration.},

In small sciences, groups---each consists of few scientists---may share and exchange parts of their own databases among each other to foster collaboration. The goal of such sharing, especially when done at early stages of the discovery process, is not to build a warehouse or a unified schema, instead the goal is to compare and verify results, detect and assess conflicts, and possibly modify or re-design the discovery process. FusionDB is designed to meet the requirements and address the challenges of such sharing model. We will demonstrate the key functionalities of FusionDB including: (1) Detecting conflicts using a rule-based model over heterogeneous schemas, (2) Assessing conflicts and providing probabilistic estimates for values' correctness, (3) Extended querying capabilities in the presence of conflicts, and (4) Providing curation operations to help scientists resolve and investigate conflicts according to different priorities. FusionDB is realized on top of PostgreSQL DBMS.},

For example, a smartwatch can assist its paired smartphone with downloading data. Inspired by the success of MPTCP, MPBond applies the concept of distributed multipath transport where multiple subflows can traverse different devices. We develop a cross-device connection management scheme, a buffering strategy, a packet scheduling algorithm, and a policy framework tailored to MPBond's architecture. We implement MPBond on commodity mobile devices such as Android smartphones and smartwatches. Our real-world evaluations using different workloads under various network conditions demonstrate the efficiency of MPBond. Compared to state-of-the-art collaboration frameworks, MPBond reduces file download time by 5% to 46%, and improves the video streaming bitrate by 2% to 118%. Meanwhile, it improves the energy efficiency by 10% to 57%.},

We investigate the effect of the robot's emotional behavior on the joint storytelling process, resulting narratives, and collaboration dynamics. Results show that when children co-create stories with a robot that exhibits emotional behaviors, they include more emotive elements in their stories and explicitly accept more ideas from their peers. We contribute with a multisensory environment that enables children with visual impairments to engage in joint storytelling activities with their peers and analyze the effect of a robot's emotional behaviors on an inclusive storytelling experience.},

Building Information Modeling (BIM) is an ICT that can be used as a powerful didactic method approach to improve e-learning outcomes. A collaborative BIM tool was implemented in a project design class in a civil engineering course. This study aims to analyze the way BIM technology supported resource sharing within and across project groups, reinforced the forms of group collaboration, and improved e-learning outcomes. This study was developed under the framework of the new educational model Tec 21 in the Tecnologico de Monterrey university system in Mexico. This study was evaluated using both qualitative (e.g., pyramid discussion) and quantitative methods (e.g., survey). The results showed that BIM helped to improve communication in the group, group sharing of resources, and supported different kinds of group collaboration. The collaborative BIM tool provided a location-independent central virtual workspace, whereas the BIM software provided enough individual capability and resources for accurate building modeling. The paper discusses the importance of embedding supportive ICTs, such as BIM, to improve e-learning in civil engineering courses, as well as the limitations and needs in this field.},

We compare the particular work arrangement in this study with other studies of porters' work, show the widely different configurations of how IT and work can be organized, and argue for the benefit of making comparative studies within CSCW.

abstract = {In collaborative planning dialogues, the agents have different beliefs about the domain and about each other; thus, it is inevitable that conflicts arise during the planning process. In this paper, we present a plan-based model for response generation during collaborative planning, based on a recursive Propose-Evaluate-Modify framework for modeling collaboration. We focus on identifying strategies for content selection when 1) the system initiates information-sharing to gather further information in order to make an informed decision about whether to accept a proposal from the user, and 2) the system initiates collaborative negotiation to negotiate with the user to resolve a detected conflict in the user's proposal. When our model determines that information-sharing should be pursued, it selects a focus of information-sharing from among multiple uncertainties that might be addressed, chooses an appropriate information-sharing strategy, and formulates a response that initiates an information-sharing subdialogue. When our model determines that conflicts must be resolved, it selects the most effective conflicts to address in resolving disagreement about the user's proposal, identifies appropriate justification for the system's claims, and formulates a response that initiates a negotiation subdialogue.},

publisher = {Australian Computer Society, Inc.},
address = {AUS},
abstract = {Access control has been studied for sometime, and there are a number of theories and techniques for handling access control for single or centralised systems; however, unique and challenging security issues concerning collaboration in the context of service oriented computing (SOC) have arisen due to the dynamic and loosely coupled nature of the environment in which these collaborations are conducted. Individual organisations usually define their access control policies independently. When a collaboration opportunity arrives, a number of problems arise, such as: determining if the collaboration is possible given the access control policies, defining the policy for the collaboration and deciding under what conditions a service is allowed to be forwarded to other parties. Furthermore, different types of collaboration, in terms of the way collaboration is carried out, require different access control support. In this paper, we propose a model encoded in description logic to capture all the necessary elements for specifying access control policy for collaboration. Based on the model, various inconsistencies between access policies from different business units are identified. The paper also shows how a description logic reasoner can be used to prove that two policies are suitable, or not suitable, for collaboration. The policy model and policies are encoded in a SROIQ knowledge base. Although access control policies focus on a single system or a single business party's requirements, the method presented in this paper allows a logical analysis of the suitability of potential collaboration partners. We believe this work is laying a foundation for access policy development, negotiation and enforcement for cross-organization collaborations.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) has been applied to collaborative learning, often to estimate collaboration quality with the use of multimodal data, which often have uneven time scales. The difference in time scales is usually handled by dividing and aggregating data using a fixed-size time window. So far, the current MMLA research lacks a systematic exploration of whether and how much window size affects the generalizability of collaboration quality estimation models. In this paper, we investigate the impact of different window sizes (e.g., 30 seconds, 60s, 90s, 120s, 180s, 240s) on the generalizability of classification models for collaboration quality and its underlying dimensions (e.g., argumentation). Our results from an MMLA study involving the use of audio and log data showed that a 60 seconds window size enabled the development of more generalizable models for collaboration quality (AUC 61%) and argumentation (AUC 64%). In contrast, for modeling dimensions focusing on coordination, interpersonal relationship, and joint information processing, a window size of 180 seconds led to better performance in terms of across-context generalizability (on average from 56% AUC to 63% AUC). These findings have implications for the eventual application of MMLA in authentic practice.},

abstract = {Security is concerned with the protection of assets from intentional harm. Secure systems provide capabilities that enable such protection to satisfy some security requirements. In a world increasingly populated with mobile and ubiquitous computing technology, the scope and boundary of security systems can be uncertain and can change. A single functional component, or even multiple components individually, are often insufficient to satisfy complex security requirements on their own.  Adaptive security aims to enable systems to vary their protection in the face of changes in their operational environment. Collaborative security, which we propose in this paper, aims to exploit the selection and deployment of multiple, potentially heterogeneous, software-intensive components to collaborate in order to meet security requirements in the face of changes in the environment, changes in assets under protection and their values, and the discovery of new threats and vulnerabilities.  However, the components that need to collaborate may not have been designed and implemented to interact with one another collaboratively. To address this, we propose a novel framework for collaborative security that combines adaptive security, collaborative adaptation and an explicit representation of the capabilities of the software components that may be needed in order to achieve collaborative security. We elaborate on each of these framework elements, focusing in particular on the challenges and opportunities afforded by (1) the ability to capture, represent, and reason about the capabilities of different software components and their operational context, and (2) the ability of components to be selected and mediated at runtime in order to satisfy the security requirements. We illustrate our vision through a collaborative robotic implementation, and suggest some areas for future work.},

abstract = {We present a preliminarily study on the influence of different sources of information in Web 2.0 systems on recommendation. Aiming to identify which are the sources of information (ratings, tags, social contacts, etc.) most valuable for recommendation, we evaluate a number of content-based, collaborative filtering and social recommenders on a heterogeneous dataset obtained from Last.fm. Moreover, aiming to investigate whether and how fusion of such information sources can benefit individual recommendation approaches, we propose various metrics to measure coverage, overlap, diversity and novelty between different sets of recommendations. The obtained results show that, in Last.fm, social tagging and explicit social networking information provide effective and heterogeneous item recommendations. Moreover, they give first insights on the feasibility of exploiting the above non performance recommendation characteristics by hybrid approaches.},

abstract = {Collaboration is important to successful organizations and how coworkers are selected is crucial to the dynamics of effective collaborations. In this study we explore how people use social network information, which is increasingly accessible on enterprise systems in organizations, to choose people with whom to collaborate. We conducted a scenario-based study of 459 respondents in a global high-tech company. Our data indicate cultural differences in how social network information was valued when choosing a collaborator. The Chinese, consistent with the cultural value of Guanxi, more closely followed a closure model, whereas Americans favored neither a closure nor a structural holes model. These results provide new insights into how needs for social network information may vary between cultures and how social networking sites might support workers in choosing collaborators from within and across national cultures.},

The supporting software framework includes a dynamically configurable intermediary to simplify the mapping of devices to applications. We describe the iStuff architecture and provide several examples of iStuff, organized into a design space of ubiquitous computing interaction components. The main contribution is a physical toolkit for distributed, heterogeneous environments with run-time retargetable device data flow.

Using a data set of 37,515 revisions from 16,616 unique editors to 96 Wikipedia articles as a case study, we analyze the prevalence and significance of different sequences of editing patterns. We illustrate the mixed method potential of sequence approaches by interpreting the frequent patterns as general classes of behavioral motifs. We conclude by discussing the methodological opportunities for using sequence analysis for expanding existing approaches to analyzing and theorizing about co-production routines in online knowledge collaboration.},

Prior studies showed that finding a proper balance and providing uninterrupted knowledge transmission between different learning modes can be challenging in such mixed pedagogical approaches. In this paper, we present a multi-device interactive educational platform named SimSnap to teach biology curriculum to middle school children. SimSnap facilitates interactions among touchscreen Chromebooks to perform in-class individual and group activities. We present a usability analysis study with eight middle school children where they learn about the influence of temperature on tomato plant growth. Our study demonstrated that SimSnap facilitates group discussions to complete collaborative tasks. It also creates seamless knowledge propagation between prior to current tasks to learn about more complex concepts from previous simpler activities. Middle school children gave overall high usability ratings and positive feedback on SimSnap. This study also helped to outline some design recommendations for future improvements of SimSnap.},

In the Metropolitan Advanced Delivery Network (MADNet) project, we explore the potential of multiple interfaces on smartphones through a collaborative design to enable energy-aware WiFi-based mobile data offloading. We advocate that the vertical collaboration across different wireless access technologies and network vendors is the key to aggregate the power of mobile operators, WiFi service providers, and end-users. Aiming at reducing the energy consumption on smartphones, we propose an energy-aware algorithm supported by our collaborative architecture to avoid offloading to low-throughput WiFi networks which may consume more energy. The evaluation of streaming applications on our prototyped Nokia N900 smartphones demonstrates that we are able to achieve more than 80% energy saving. Our experiment in the wild also shows that our design can tolerate the minor errors of localization, mobility prediction, and offload capacity estimation.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supporting adaptable consistency protocols in collaborative systems. Our approach cleanly separates data and control, allowing consistency protocols to be dynamically attached to shared data at the object level. Protocols can be switched at run time without modifying source code.},

abstract = {It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the Grids Meet Autonomic Computing Workshop -- GMAC'09. At the core of the autonomic computing is the fact that high-level goals should be exposed by the middleware and should be easily tuned by users and system administrators. As grids become more and more the infrastructure for e-Science, grids and autonomic research had to find a forum where grid experts can expose grid trends to, and search for new models from autonomics ones. The idea of providing such a forum emerged at ICAC 2008, and resulted in the organization of this year's workshop in association with ICAC 2009. The focus of the workshop is to identify key scientific challenges related to the management and future of grids as a specific category of complex, heterogeneous, and rapidly evolving large-scale systems. The goal of the workshop is to promote community wide discussion of, and collaboration on potentially high-impact ideas that will influence and foster continued research in improving the scalability, manageability and reliability of grids.The papers presented cover a variety of approaches for the cross-fertilization of grids and autonomics, including conceptual frameworks for Autonomic Computational Science, collaborative agents and reinforcement learning. Experiences from engineering, deploying, and analyzing production grids and applications are also reported. In addition, the program features two keynote speeches: Robert Jones on the EGEE Grid and its Experiences in the Use of e-Infrastructures for World-class Science, and Manish Parashar on the Role of Autonomics in Emerging Grid Ecosystems. The panel on the Grid/Cloud/Autonomic convergence completes the program, and will create a further bridge to other workshops associated with ICAC, especially VTDC.},

abstract = {Modern cities are supported by many IT systems managed by distinct public and private agents. Such legacy systems are often incompatible since, in general, they use old, dependent and non-standardised technologies. This results in an environment in which there is no interoperability among smart city systems, preventing richer and more interesting applications to be used by citizens, companies, and city administration. An alternative to solve the lack of interoperability is the adoption of a System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. A SoS is a set of independent and heterogeneous constituent systems that interoperate to accomplish a global mission. The collaboration among such constituent systems enables a SoS to offer new functionalities that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose SoS-centric middleware services to support the management and execution of SoS in Smart Cities environments in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed services, once integrated into a smart city platform, support interoperability among different systems operating in a city. Moreover, this paper also presents a motivational case study to make it clear the issues that must be addressed when multiple independent systems are brought together to provide a new Smart City service or application.},

abstract = {We have recently witnessed an explosion of user-generated content (UGC) sharing, particularly video clips, as the new killer Internet application. Given the sheer amount of resource demands, the peer-to-peer (or peer-assisted) model has been suggested for this new service scenario. There are however a series of unique challenges from the UGC videos to be addressed, in particular, their significantly shorter lengths. As such, any delay, even being minor as compared to those for conventional movie-like videos, will be perceptually amplified.Given the much more stringent delay requirement, the UGC video sharing thus calls for sophisticated scheduling to provide quality playback. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative delay-aware scheduling (CODAS) that is customized for the short UGC videos. CODAS improves playback quality and reduces server workload, through adaptive prioritization of data requests and tighter collaboration between peer suppliers and the server.We present detailed design and optimization of CODAS, particularly the synergy policies in different zones of a shrinking window. We evaluate it through extensive trace-driven simulations and PlanetLab prototype experiments, and the results show the great improvement over the state-of-the-art solutions.},

This tendency requires a deeper understanding of their specificities to adequately inform design. To this end, we ran a study with 36 elementary school children to compare two AR/MR interaction paradigms for mobile technologies: (1) the consolidated "Window-on-the-World" (WoW), and (2) the emerging "World-as-Support" (WaS). By analyzing children's understanding and use of space while playing an AR/MR mystery game, and analyzing the collaboration that emerges among them, we show that the two paradigms scaffold children's attention differently during the experience and elicit different forms of collaboration. We conclude by presenting a conceptual framework to distinguish the strengths, weaknesses, and potential of the two AR/MR paradigms, as well as the comparison between marker-based and marker-less technical solutions. This study aims at helping practitioners in taking design decisions for AR/MR technologies for children.},

abstract = {Motivation -- The driving theme for this investigation has been to present a different perspective on decision making and the effect of decisions made on the collaboration involved in a complex work process. This work is influenced by the recent change in perception towards the conceptualization of decisions and their bearing on collaborative work. Instead of viewing decisions as just a mental act the change in perception is to view it as a device for managing and coordinating activities (Brown, 2005). This investigation endeavours to demonstrate how decisions made by people in a work process not only determines their individual actions but also supports and facilitates collaborative work. This is achieved by viewing decisions as abstract information resources that encourage appropriate distribution of information, distribution of cognitive tasks, and coordination between individuals and teams involved in the work process.Research approach -- A series of ethnographically inspired studies carried out to study the work of airport staff (Fields, Amaldi et al., 2005; Selvaraj, 2006) at an European airport over a year has been instrumental in supporting the notion put forth in this paper. Data collection was performed by engaging in observation, note-taking, and semi-structured interviews with personnel in the control tower, etc. Observation sessions typically lasted between two and four hours. The field material consists of data from several sources, i.e. notes, audio recordings, photographs, and interview transcripts. Scenarios have been elicited from transcriptions of audio recordings of conversations taking place between people in the tower and those involved in the activities of the tower as well as from interviews conducted with personnel in the control tower. Apart from this, observation and notes from the fieldwork augment our understanding of these scenarios and help steer the ensuing discussions.Findings/Design -- This paper is an initial step towards investigating the notion of decisions as mechanisms for organizing collaborative work The analysis of the complex work process of air traffic control reveals that decisions made by individuals and groups in the course of their work activities determine the coordination and integration of contextually appropriate actions and interactions necessary to accomplish tasks.Take away message -- Rethink the notion of decision making; decisions play a significant role in organizing various aspects of collaborative work and are not just mental acts.},

We present our open toolkit that provides a flexible end-to-end solution for building such systems using off-the-shelf hardware. From related work, three core design aspects have been identified: 1) the independence of the viewpoint that the visitor (the remote expert) can take in relation to position and viewpoint of the visitee, 2) the immersiveness of the presentation technology for visitor and visitee, and 3) the extent to which the visitor's body is represented in the visitee's environment. This paper describes the implementation of our system, which includes these aspects. In a study aimed at validating whether we implemented these core aspects to good effect, conducted with a collaborative puzzle application built with our toolkit, we examine how variations of these aspects contribute to usability, performance and social presence related metrics.},

The mobile cloud collaboration system is composed of three stages: 1) mobile stage: a light-weighted threshold method is used to filter out activities of daily livings (ADLs), 2) collaboration stage: TCP protocol is used to transmit data to cloud and meanwhile features are extracted in the cloud, 3) cloud stage: the model trained by FEDT is deployed to give the final detection result with the extracted features. Experiments show that the proposed FEDT outperforms the others' over 1-3% both on sensitivity and specificity and has superior robustness on different devices.},

abstract = {Explanation of artificial intelligence (AI) decision-making has become an important research area in human–computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported teamwork research. While plenty of research has investigated AI explanations with an intent to improve AI transparency and human trust in AI, how AI explanations function in teaming environments remains unclear. Given that a major benefit of AI giving explanations is to increase human trust understanding how AI explanations impact human trust is crucial to effective human-AI teamwork. An online experiment was conducted with 156 participants to explore this question by examining how a teammate’s explanations impact the perceived trust of the teammate and the effectiveness of the team and how these impacts vary based on whether the teammate is a human or an AI. This study shows that explanations facilitate trust in AI teammates when explaining why AI disobeyed humans’ orders but hindered trust when explaining why an AI lied to humans. In addition, participants’ personal characteristics (e.g., their gender and the individual’s ethical framework) impacted their perceptions of AI teammates both directly and indirectly in different scenarios. Our study contributes to interactive intelligent systems and HCI by shedding light on how an AI teammate’s actions and corresponding explanations are perceived by humans while identifying factors that impact trust and perceived effectiveness. This work provides an initial understanding of AI explanations in human-AI teams, which can be used for future research to build upon in exploring AI explanation implementation in collaborative environments.},

abstract = {Prior analyses of collaboration through different notational systems (e.g., threaded discussions and evidence maps) have documented differential influences of notations on collaborative processes as well as ways in which groups appropriate these notations for their work. These prior analyses have focused on collaborative interaction, yet for instrumental purposes in educational practice, the individual is the unit of analysis. Hence it is relevant to ask how individuals use the products of collaborative interaction as documented in a given notational system. This paper reports on an analysis of data from a prior study to uncover how participants went about writing individual essays, drawing on the products of interactionally prior joint problem solving. The analysis first documented parameters of the human-computer interactions through which individual participants accessed and appropriated the record of prior work. Parameters included focus shifts, use of copy/paste, and access to records of data and hypotheses considered. The analysis then compared three experimental conditions and two post-hoc groups on the selected parameters. Profiles plots reveal consistent differences between the use of the notational systems that are indicative of differences in engagement with the materials.},

While much existing adaptive assistance has focused on providing explicit feedback directly to the relevant student, we propose a two-dimensional design space which explores alternative methods of adaptive assistance that are implicit, indirect, or both. We investigated the viability of these ideas using data collected in a classroom evaluation of an ACLS system for peer tutoring which incorporated the design ideas in a manner that provided cognitive support to peer tutors. In this paper, we discuss how students interacted with the different forms of feedback, and propose a second iteration of the assistance that involves collaborative support in addition to domain support.},

abstract = {A consortium consisting of TNO (The Netherlands), Sagem DS (France), BAE Systems (UK) and ITTI (Poland) has been awarded a contract by the European Defence Agency (EDA) and entails the building of a distributed Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) simulation testbed demonstrator. The contract started in January 2008 and will run for a period of 9 months.EDA identified joint testing and certification of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as a key topic to promote the development of standards and common procedures across UAV projects carried out by EDA participant Member States (pMS). Consequently, demonstrating a common UAV testing and certification environment was selected as one of the projects to be funded out of EDA's operational budget. By the end of the project EDA require:• A Technical description of the UAV testbed demonstrator detailed to a level permitting straightforward access to the distributed collaborative framework by interested third-parties,• An Execution of a multinational experiment involving UAV stakeholders,• A Detailed description of the experiment set-up process,• A Report on Lessons Learned from the building and the employment of the prototype,• Conclusions and Recommendations for a future European Distributed UAV testbed Capability.The consortium believes that the 2 key objectives of the distributed testbed demonstrator are:• To show to the UAV stakeholders that it is technically possible to rapidly build and use a geographically distributed testbed, that will have persistence after completion of the project, within the pMS.• To show organisations the benefits of collaboration and contribute to convergence amongst the UAV stakeholders within Europe.To ensure maximum impact on UAV stakeholders, the testbed demonstrator will involve additional organizations apart from the 4 consortium members, including one or more SMEs, will have a capability that the contributors currently don't have themselves and which addresses their current issues, will incorporate hardware in the loop to allow the testing of hardware components, allow niche area SMEs to test their components in a broader UAV context, and will be used to provide recommendations on how to build distributed testbeds.A demonstrator architecture has been proposed and this will be confirmed following discussion with all participants. The core architecture and generic demonstration management components supporting the architecture have the following goals:• To provide an architecture for the Demonstrator that will allow easy and rapid integration of both hardware and software components.• To facilitate the design, implementation and deployment of components that will allow the system demonstrator to be built with the required functionality and capabilities.• To provide an architecture suitable to support both demonstration and experimentation.The demonstrator will use the HLA simulation standard and in its prototype form make use of an available research network, such as GEANT. It is planned to have a few interim demonstrations prior to a final demonstration of the prototype to the EDA customer. Key technical challenges are expected to be in the integration across a European-wide WAN with accessibility to a variety of different organisations},

Twenty-eight children, aged 3 to 4.5 years old, explored sound in their environment through three toy prototypes. One toy focused on hearing sounds in relation to their environment; such as traffic and children playing. Another toy explored the recording and playback of their own sounds, being "caught" in a racket and blown out. The third toy explored a combination of shaking in sounds, stirring them to manipulate them, and pouring the mix out. This project uses a mixed-methods approach and is presented as a step towards further studies comparing toys with different approaches to sound.},

abstract = {Computer-assisted systems can provide efficient and engaging ASD intervention environments for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, most existing computer-assisted systems target only one skill deficit (e.g., social conversation skills) and ignore the importance of other areas, such as motor skills, that could also impact social interaction. This focus on a single domain may hinder the generalizability of learned skills to real-world scenarios, because the targeted teaching strategies do not reflect that real-world tasks often involve more than one skill domain. The work presented in this article seeks to bridge this gap by developing a Collaborative Haptic-gripper virtual skill training system (C-Hg). This system includes individual and collaborative games that provide opportunities for simultaneously practicing both fine motor skills (hand movement and grip control skills) as well as social skills (communication and collaboration) and investigating how they relate to each other. We conducted a usability study with 10 children with ASD and 10 Typically Developing (TD) children (8–12 years), who used C-Hg to play a series of individual and collaborative games requiring differing levels of motor and communication skill. Results revealed that participant performance significantly improved in both individual and collaborative fine motor skill training tasks, including significant improvements in collaborative manipulations between partners. Participants with ASD were found to conduct more collaborative manipulations and initiate more conversations with their partners in the post collaborative tasks, suggesting more active collaboration and communication of participants with ASD in the collaborative tasks. Results support the potential of our C-Hg system for simultaneously improving fine motor and social skills, with implications for impacts of improved fine motor skills on social outcomes.},

This paper presents a study of a mixed reality system that allows web, virtual reality and physical visitors to share a museum visit together in real time. Our system allows visitors to share their location and orientation, communicate over a voice channel, and jointly navigate around a shared information space. Results from a study of 34 users of the system show that visiting with the system was highly interactive and retained many of the attractions of a traditional shared exhibition visit. Specifically, users could navigate together, collaborate around objects and discuss exhibits. These findings have implications for non-museum settings, in particular how location awareness is a powerful resource for collaboration, and how 'hybrid objects' can support collaboration at-a-distance.},

It can be challenging for the remote user to obtain the right view of the local user and to understand the spatial relationship between the disjointed views of task space areas. We present SceneCam, a prototype with which we use AR to explore different techniques for improving multi-camera remote collaboration by making optimal camera selection easier and faster for the remote user and by making the spatial relationship between task space areas explicit. To this end, SceneCam implements two camera selection techniques: nudging the remote user to select an optimal camera view of the local user, and automatic selection of an optimal camera view of the local user. Furthermore, SceneCam provides the remote user with two focus-in-context views - exocentric and egocentric views - that visualize the spatial relationship between the multiple task space areas and the local user.},

abstract = {There is a steadily growing interest in the design of spaces in which multiple interactive surfaces are present and, in turn, in understanding their role in group activity. However, authentic activities in these multi-surface spaces can be complex. Groups commonly use digital and non-digital artefacts, tools and resources, in varied ways depending on their specific social and epistemic goals. Thus, designing for collaboration in such spaces can be very challenging. Importantly, there is still a lack of agreement on how to approach the analysis of groups' experiences in these heterogeneous spaces. This paper presents an actionable approach that aims to address the complexity of understanding multi-user multi-surface systems. We provide a structure for applying different analytical tools in terms of four closely related dimensions of user activity: the setting, the tasks, the people and the runtime co-configuration. The applicability of our approach is illustrated with six types of analysis of group activity in a multi-surface design studio.},

abstract = {Truly heterogeneous systems enable partitioned workloads to be mapped to the hardware that nets the best performance. However, current practice requires that inter-device communication between different vendors' hardware use host memory as an intermediary step. To date, there are no widely adopted solutions that allow accelerators to directly transfer data. A new cache-coherent protocol, CXL, aims to facilitate easier, fine-grained sharing between accelerators. In this work we analyze existing methods for designing heterogeneous applications that target GPUs and FPGAs working collaboratively, followed by an exploration to show the benefits of a CXL-enabled system. Specifically, we develop a test application that utilizes both an NVIDIA P100 GPU and a Xilinx U250 FPGA to show current communication limitations. From this application, we capture overall execution time and throughput measurements on the FPGA and GPU. We use these measurements as inputs to novel CXL performance models to show that using CXL caching instead of host memory results in a 1.31X speedup, while a more tightly-coupled pipelined implementation using CXL-enabled hardware would result in a speedup of 1.45X.},

abstract = {Integrated recommendation, which aims at jointly recommending heterogeneous items from different channels in a main feed, has been widely applied to various online platforms. Though attractive, integrated recommendation requires the ranking methods to migrate from conventional user-item models to the new user-channel-item paradigm in order to better capture users' preferences on both item and channel levels. Moreover, practical feed recommendation systems usually impose exposure constraints on different channels to ensure user experience. This leads to greater difficulty in the joint ranking of heterogeneous items. In this paper, we investigate the integrated recommendation task with exposure constraints in practical recommender systems. Our contribution is forth-fold. First, we formulate this task as a binary online linear programming problem and propose a two-layer framework named Multi-channel Integrated Recommendation with Exposure Constraints~(MIREC) to obtain the optimal solution. Second, we propose an efficient online allocation algorithm to determine the optimal exposure assignment of different channels from a global view of all user requests over the entire time horizon. We prove that this algorithm reaches the optimal point under a regret bound of O (√T) with linear complexity. Third, we propose a series of collaborative models to determine the optimal layout of heterogeneous items at each user request. The joint modeling of user interests, cross-channel correlation, and page context in our models aligns more with the browsing nature of feed products than existing models. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both offline datasets and online A/B tests to verify the effectiveness of MIREC. The proposed framework has now been implemented on the homepage of Taobao to serve the main traffic.},

We have developed a special case of this collaboration model in which the switch occurs when users face and overcome difficulty and the level of sharing in the synchronous mode can vary. The model supports multiple forms and degrees of awareness of the remote difficulty, and allows multiple kinds and degrees of sharing. It is scalable in that it allows a single helper to resolve the difficulties of a large number of people in difficulty. It has been implemented for a programming class and motivated by experience using a previous system in such a class. However, in principle, its structure is independent of the activity causing difficulty. A video demonstration of this work is available at http://youtu.be/1-AqMCidx48.},

However, most of these systems require special equipment and cannot adapt to everyday environment. We introduce Second Surface, a novel multi-user Augmented reality system that fosters a real-time interaction for user-generated contents on top of the physical environment. This interaction takes place in the physical surroundings of everyday objects such as trees or houses. Our system allows users to place three dimensional drawings, texts, and photos relative to such objects and share this expression with any other person who uses the same software at the same spot. Second Surface explores a vision that integrates collaborative virtual spaces into the physical space. Our system can provide an alternate reality that generates a playful and natural interaction in an everyday setup.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are ubiquitous, heterogeneous and resource constrained. Execution of complex tasks in mobile devices are resource demanding and time-consuming, forcing developers to offload portions of the complex task to cloud or edge computing resources. Task offloading becomes increasingly challenging due to intermittent Internet connectivity, remote resource unavailability, high costs, latency, and limited energy of the mobile device. A mobile device user is typically surrounded by other mobile devices, which can be leveraged to collaboratively compute a resource-intensive task. With the help of a work sharing framework, it is feasible for devices to communicate and collaborate. However, some mobile devices are incapable of computing complex portions of the task, and some can compute in accelerated mode. In this demonstration, we introduce Honeybee-T a collaborative mobile crowd computing framework that uses a work-stealing algorithm. The algorithm allows work sharing with collaborating devices based on devices' computational ability and task-dependencies. The experiments show that by employing Honeybee-T framework, when compared to monolithic execution of a large compute-intensive task, there is a considerable performance gain, as well as energy savings.},

abstract = {This lightning talk presents an ongoing effort investigating the use of a collaborative programming paradigm originating in industry called Mob Programming, for effective collaborative learning in the classroom. In industry, Mob Programming involves the participation of a group of developers solving one problem at the same time and place. Developers take turns cycling through a structured process for collaboration having been assigned pre-defined roles responsible for brainstorming ideas, deciding on a path forward and implementing the consensus decision respectively. Pedagogically, there are several compelling reasons to motivate the adoption of Mob Programming in learning settings . First, the collaboration is well-structured meaning that the interaction between even a large group of students will not descend into chaos. Second, students are assigned to roles, which allows for the differentiation of responsibilities and development of skills in different aspects of solving the problem. Third, the rotation of assigned roles allows students to learn and exhibit multiple competencies as well as appreciate bringing different perspectives to bear on solving the problem. In order to investigate whether this promise is borne out in practice, the paradigm is currently being investigated in the context of a Cloud Computing course offered online to undergraduate and graduate students at a large American university and its satellite campuses. Since this effort is still underway, faculty who implement or are interested in implementing collaborative learning for this classrooms are invited to attend and provide feedback or consider joining the effort to investigate this paradigm for use in learning settings.},

abstract = {Embedded intelligence is becoming the primary driver for new applications in industry, healthcare, and automotive, to name a few. The main characteristics of these applications are high computational demand, real-time interaction with the environment, security, low power consumption, and local autonomy, among others. Addressing these diverse characteristics, researchers have proposed heterogeneous multicore embedded systems comprising CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs. Whereas each computing element provides a unique capability to enable one of the application characteristics, collaborating these processing cores in running an application to get the maximum performance is a crucial challenge. This paper considers the collaborative usage of a multicore CPU and an FPGA in a heterogeneous embedded system to improve the performance of sparse matrix operations, which have been essential techniques in reducing the inference complexity in machine learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks. Experimental results show that the collaborative execution of sparse-matrix-dense-matrix multiplication on the Xilinx Zynq MPSoC, a heterogeneous CPU+FPGA embedded system, can improve the performance by a factor of up to 42% compared with just using the FPGA as an accelerator.},

abstract = {It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the Grids Meet Autonomic Computing workshop -- GMAC'10. At the core of the autonomic computing is the fact that high-level goals should be exposed by the middleware and should be easily tuned by users, applications and system administrators. As grids become more and more the infrastructure for e-Science, grids and autonomic research have to find a forum where grid experts can expose grid trends to, and search for new models from autonomics ones. The idea of providing such a forum emerged at ICAC 2008, and resulted in the organization of the first GMAC workshop in association with ICAC 2009 in Barcelona.The workshop continues the effort and focus of GMAC'09 -- to identify key scientific challenges related to the management and future of grids as a specific category of complex, heterogeneous, and rapidly evolving largescale systems. The goal of the workshop is to promote community wide discussion of, and collaboration on potentially high-impact ideas that will influence and foster continued research in improving the scalability, manageability and reliability of grids.The emergence of Web-scale infrastructure offers new opportunities for distributed applications -- both scientific and enterprise that can utilize infrastructures at this scale. The design of effective and efficient Dynamic Distributed Applications is one of the key challenges shared by Cloud Computing and Grids. A special focus of this second edition of GMAC was thus application-level autonomics.The papers presented cover approaches for the cross-fertilization of grids and autonomics, including conceptual frameworks for Autonomic Computational Science, and collaborative agents. Experiences from engineering, deploying, and analyzing production grids and applications are also reported. In addition, the program features a keynote speech by Jose Fortes, University of Florida, and a plenary panel on, "Towards Grid/Clouds Challenges for Autonomic Computing". The goal of the panel is to advance the issue raised at the GMAC'09 panel, and also at ICAC'09: how can Autonomic Computing demonstrate its contributions to addressing key issues in Grid and Cloud computing.},

abstract = {At present, using a large number of unsafe IoT devices to form botnets and launching DDoS attacks have become one of the main threats to IoT security. However, most of the existing DDoS attack defense methods are limited to being implemented within a single controller management network domain. In fact, many IoT devices that attackers build botnets are usually located in the jurisdiction of different controllers. Therefore, a mechanism is needed for each domain to cooperate with each other and share information about the attack source, so as to realize the defense against DDoS attacks across multiple domains. Blockchain technology's decentralization and group trusted collaboration mechanism provide a new method for solving cross-domain DDoS attack defense. This article combines SDN and blockchain with IoT, and proposes a cross-domain collaborative DDoS defense scheme based on blockchain and SDN architecture. It allows multiple SDN-based domains to collaborate with each other and share attack source information in a decentralized manner, making collaborative DDoS attack defense across multiple domains more flexible. Experimental results show that the defense mechanism has flexibility, feasibility, and safety.},

This has motivated a significant amount of research on heterogeneous computing techniques, along with the design of CPU-GPU fused chips and petascale heterogeneous supercomputers. In this article, we survey Heterogeneous Computing Techniques (HCTs) such as workload partitioning that enable utilizing both CPUs and GPUs to improve performance and/or energy efficiency. We review heterogeneous computing approaches at runtime, algorithm, programming, compiler, and application levels. Further, we review both discrete and fused CPU-GPU systems and discuss benchmark suites designed for evaluating Heterogeneous Computing Systems (HCSs). We believe that this article will provide insights into the workings and scope of applications of HCTs to researchers and motivate them to further harness the computational powers of CPUs and GPUs to achieve the goal of exascale performance.},

However, the current state of smart cities often consists of siloed systems, with different actors and stakeholders managing their services and assets independently. This phenomenon is evident in both technological and operational domains, posing challenges to seamless collaboration. In this context, new cloud computing models and technologies like event and service mesh promise to reduce the burden associated with the development and integration of solutions. In the attempt to pave the way for more integrated IT environments, we propose a practical architecture that combines service and event mesh technologies, enabling the seamless exploitation of service invocation and composition based on event distribution and direct service calls. Our proposal allows applications to remain transparent of the underlying technology, facilitating various optimizations on the network and management plane, necessary to meet the diverse operational requirements of complex and heterogeneous applications. We validate our proposal in a real-use case scenario implementation, discussing the tradeoffs that emerge.},

abstract = {The "Software as a Service" (SaaS) model of cloud computing popularized online multiuser collaborative software. Two famous examples of this class of software are Office 365 from Microsoft and Google Workspace. Cloud technology removes the need to install and update the software on end users' computers and provides the necessary underlying infrastructure for online collaboration. However, to provide a good end-user experience, cloud services require an infrastructure able to scale up to the task and allow low-latency interactions with a variety of users worldwide. This is a limiting factor for actors that do not possess such infrastructure. Unlike cloud computing which forgets the computational and interactional capabilities of end users' devices, the edge computing paradigm promises to exploit them as much as possible. To investigate the potential of edge computing over cloud computing, this paper presents a method for engineering interactive collaborative software supported by edge devices for the replacement of cloud computing resources. Our method is able to handle user interface aspects such as connection, execution, migration, and disconnection differently depending on the available technology. We exemplify our approach by developing a distributed Pictionary game deployed in two scenarios: a nonshared scenario where each participant interacts only with their own device and a shared scenario where participants also share a common device, including a TV. After a theoretical comparative study of edge vs. cloud computing, an experiment compares the two implementations to determine their effect on the end user's perceived experience and latency vs. real latency.},

abstract = {Interactive multi-view video enables users to enjoy the video from different viewpoints. Yet multi-view dramatically increases the video data volume and their computation, making realtime transmission and interactions a challenging task. It therefore calls for efficient view synthesis strategies that flexibly generate visual views. In this paper, we present a collaborative view synthesis strategy for online interactive multi-view video streaming based on Depth-Image Based Rendering (DIBR) view synthesis technology, which generates a visual view with the texture and depth information on both sides. Different from the traditional DIBR algorithm for single view synthesis, we explore the collaboration relationship between different viewpoints synthesis for a range of visual views generation, and propose Shift DIBR (S-DIBR). In S-DIBR, only the projected pixels, rather than all the pixels of the reference view, are utilized for next visual view generation. Therefore, the computation complexity of projection transform, which is the most computation intensive process in the traditional DIBR algorithm, is reduced to fulfill the requirement of online interactive streaming. Experiment results validate the efficiency of our collaborative view synthesis strategy, as well as the bandwidth scalability of the streaming system.},

abstract = {This paper describes the goals, design and initial challenges encountered in teaching a globally distributed software development course in collaboration between the University of Victoria, Canada and Aalto University, Finland. The project-driven collaboration course involved 16 students in Canada and nine students in Finland, divided into three globally distributed Scrum teams working on the same project. The teams worked on extending Agilefant, an open-source backlog management system, in direct interaction with its product owner. The collaborative development is based on the Scrum methodology. We describe how the Scrum methodology was implemented, and adapted to work in a distributed environment, as well as the infrastructure used to support collaboration, e.g. local war-rooms, and multiple communication tools. We conclude the paper with describing initial challenges encountered, including cultural, semester, course and curriculum differences, as well as technical and time-zone issues.},

abstract = {Tangible Windows are a novel concept for interacting with virtual 3D information spaces in a workbench-like multi-display environment. They allow for performing common 3D interaction tasks in a more accessible manner by combining principles of tangible interaction, head-coupled perspective, and multi-touch techniques. Tangible Windows unify the interaction and representation space in a single device. They either act as physical peepholes into a virtual 3D world or as physical containers for parts of that world and are well-suited for the collaborative exploration and manipulation of such information spaces. One important feature of Tangible Windows is that the use of obtrusive hardware, such as HMDs, is strictly avoided. Instead, lightweight paper-based displays are used. We present different techniques for canonical 3D interaction tasks such as viewport control or object selection and manipulation, based on the combination of independent input modalities. We tested these techniques on a self-developed prototype system and received promising early user feedback.},

abstract = {The Penn State RS/6000 SP is a uniquely acquired and operated computing facility. This 143 CPU machine, centrally located and jointly owned, is a result of collaboration between academic departments, research groups, and the central academic computing facility. It is the largest on-campus resource at Penn State for meeting the high performance computing needs.Due to the joint ownership structure of the machine, the job scheduling requirements are significantly different from the usual methods of job processor allocation in distributed memory parallel machines. After several years of adapting different queuing systems, primarily the Distributed Queuing System, to our needs, it became obvious that the conventional scheduling systems did not serve the machine scheduling requirements unique to the Penn State SP. We concluded that a robust and easily configurable system needs to be developed to meet our unique needs. We have drawn inspiration from and modeled our system on EASY. As with EASY, we use the application programming interface of LoadLeveler to implement our scheduler. Our scheduler is named Penn State Condominium Scheduler (PSCS). PSCS does policy implementation and job execution on the machine is done by LoadLeveler.PSCS is written to facilitate easier configuration and administration. It does not have any processor architecture dependence. It is similar to the native scheduler in LoadLeveler in this regard. PSCS has incorporated three unique features: (i) node owner affinity which ensures fairness by allocation based on ownership, (ii) backfilling which ensures efficient utilization of resources, and (iii) affinity for services provided which ensures proper matching of jobs to the processors based on memory, software and other requirements. Jobs from users who own nodes in the SP complex have affinity to those particular processors owned by them. They also have preferences granted to them depending on their ownership level. Once the demand from the node owners is met, the next important goal is to keep the machine as fully occupied with running jobs as possible. This is accomplished by backfilling. This scheduler incorporates these features which are most important to successful implementation of multi-owner, centrally located, heterogeneous computing facilities.},

abstract = {Emerging wearable and mobile communication technologies, such as lightweight head-mounted displays (HMDs) and handheld devices, promise support for everyday remote collaboration. Despite their potential for widespread use, their effectiveness as collaborative tools is unknown, particularly in physical tasks involving mobility. To better understand their impact on collaborative behaviors, perceptions, and performance, we conducted a two-by-two (technology type: HMD vs. tablet computer; task setting: static vs. dynamic) between-subjects study where participants (n=66) remotely collaborated as ``helper' and ``worker' pairs in the construction of a physical object. Our results showed that, in the dynamic task, HMD use enabled helpers to offer more frequent directing commands and more proactive assistance, resulting in marginally faster task completion. In the static task, while tablet use helped convey subtle visual information, helpers and workers had conflicting perceptions of how the two technologies contributed to their success. Our findings offer strong design and research implications, underlining the importance of a consistent view of the shared workspace and the differential support collaborators with different roles receive from technologies.},

In this paper we present a Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration system that enables a local worker to share a live 3D panorama of his/her surroundings with a remote expert. The remote expert can also share task instructions back to the local worker using visual cues in addition to verbal communication. We conducted a user study to investigate how sharing augmented gaze and gesture cues from the remote expert to the local worker could affect the overall collaboration performance and user experience. We found that by combing gaze and gesture cues, our remote collaboration system could provide a significantly stronger sense of co-presence for both the local and remote users than using the gaze cue alone. The combined cues were also rated significantly higher than the gaze in terms of ease of conveying spatial actions.},

abstract = {The critical value of interdisciplinarity is increasingly accepted not only for promoting the responsible use of machine learning models, but also for increasing their performance. Social scientists can then help engineers better understand the population they are gathering data from. To be successful, however, interdisciplinary collaborations require more than just gathering researchers from various fields around a table. They call for addressing challenges such as developing a common language, understanding different ways of reasoning, and addressing epistemic controversies to agree on shared criteria upon which can be assessed the validity of the co-produced knowledge. Controversies bring about relevant epistemic questions to promote an ongoing reflection on scientific methods. In contrast, when a discipline leverages its own methods to approach a topic traditionally associated with another discipline, the unsolicited interference is often followed by a backlash which undermines the possibility of collaboration (e.g., [1], [2], [3]).New environments emerge in academic centers willing to welcome interdisciplinary research and a key challenge is creating practices and methodologies that could enable such research. Computational philosophy is the approach I develop to serve this goal. I present here two examples of such collaborations I have led, as a philosopher, alongside machine learning engineers. These collaborations resulted in great outcomes and significantly advanced the state of the art in the domain of online social interactions.The first example is an empirical study on misinformation based on an analysis of user-generated reports from Facebook and Instagram [4]. The mixed approach I developed with Onur \c{C}elebi allowed us to identify meaningful variations in the volumes and types of false news, as well as in the manipulative strategies developed to spread misinformation among countries and platforms. Thanks to an original typology we created to classify content, we were able to identify four distinct types of behaviors for users reporting content to moderators. This allowed us to propose explanations for up to 55% of the inaccuracy in user reports, suggest solutions to improve the overall signal by taking action on the different sources of inaccuracy, and build a classifier capable of distinguishing credible user reports from others to support misinformation detection.The second example is an empirical study of social influencers on Instagram [5]. Fran\c{c}ois Charton and I developed an original typology to classify Instagram influencers based on their source of legitimacy. This allowed us to identify different kinds of audiences characteristic of the different types of influencers, which we analyzed through Ren\'{e} Girard's mimetic desire theory [6]. This research enriched Girard's philosophical theory while it helped us advance the understanding of social interactions between influencers and their followers by superimposing a communication system inspired by Marshall McLuhan's media theory onto them [7]. Leveraging different signals, we were then able to identify for each category of influencer which kinds of posts were most likely to generate a positive response and negative feedback.I am now expanding my approach to hate speech, bringing together the psychological mechanisms of hate conceptualized by Girard [8] to better understand the manifestations of hate on Instagram. These three blocks should then allow me to present a holistic approach to online interactions upon which an ethical system for the moderation of problematic online interactions could be erected.},

Such policies allow work to be divided among collaborators with the aim of preventing redundancy and optimizing the synergic effects of collaboration. Most of the underlying methods achieve these goals by the means of explicit vs. implicit role-based mediation. In this paper, we investigate whether and how different factors, such as users' behavior, search strategies, and effectiveness, are related to role assignment within a collaborative exploratory search. Our main findings suggest that: (1) spontaneous and cohesive implicit roles might emerge during the collaborative search session implying users with no prior roles, and that these implicit roles favor the search precision, (2) role drift might occur alongside the search session performed by users with prior-assigned roles.},

abstract = {A main reason of driver distraction is the execution of tertiary driving tasks through an in-vehicle-infotainment system (IVIS). Prior research indicates that input from passengers – especially on tertiary tasks – has the potential to mitigate driver distraction. However, the interplay between driver distraction and driver-passenger collaboration has not been researched in detail. Therefore, we compare five IVIS concepts (single and dual-screen setups) which illustrate different collaborative approaches (Consensual, Token-Ring, Hierarchical, Autocratic, and Anarchic IVIS) with the goal to investigate their effect on drivers’ workload, glance behavior (eyes-off-the-road time) and driving performance (speed, lane position). We found that the most distracting events are when the driver receives pop-up notifications, or when the front-seat passenger interacts with an IVIS screen. Besides that, our insights indicate that despite research-substantiated benefits of dual-screen IVIS setups compared to single-screen ones in terms of collaboration, they have a higher implication on driver distraction and workload.},

abstract = {To achieve device-free person detection, various types of signal features, such as moving statistics and wavelet representations, have been extracted from the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Index (RSSI), whose value fluctuates when human subjects move near the Wi-Fi transceivers. However, these features do not work effectively under different deployments of Wi-Fi transceivers because each transceiver has a unique RSSI fluctuation pattern that depends on its specific wireless channel and hardware characteristics. To address this problem, we present WiDet, a system that uses a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach for person detection. The CNN achieves effective and robust detection feature extraction by exploring distinguishable patterns in Wi-Fi RSSI data. With a large number of internal parameters, the CNN can record and recognize the different RSSI fluctuation patterns from different transceivers. We further apply the data augmentation method to improve the algorithm robustness to wireless interferences and pedestrian speed changes. To take advantage of the wide availability of the existing Wi-Fi devices, we design a collaborative sensing technique that can recognize the subject moving directions. To validate the proposed design, we implement a prototype system that consists of three Wi-Fi packet transmitters and one receiver on low-cost off-the-shelf embedded development boards. In a multi-day experiment with a total of 163 walking events, WiDet achieves 94.5% of detection accuracy in detecting pedestrians, which outperforms the moving statistics and the wavelet representation based approaches by 22% and 8%, respectively.},

abstract = {There are many ways to build a predictive model from data. Besides the numerous classification or regression algorithms to choose from, there are countless possibilities of useful data transformation prior to modeling. To assist in discovering good predictive analytics workflows, we introduced recently a collaborative analytics system that allows workflow sharing and reuse. We designed a recommendation engine for the system to enable matching of analytics needs with relevant workflows stored in repository. The engine relies on meta-predictive modeling of traffic-analysis workflow-characteristics. In this paper, we present a feasibility study of applying this collaborative analytics system to predict traffic congestion. Different ways to build predictive models from traffic dataset are pooled as shared workflows. We demonstrate that through dynamic recommendation of workflows that are suitable for the real-time varying traffic data, a reliable congestion prediction can be achieved. The promising results showcase that systematic collaboration among data scientists made possible by our system can be a powerful tool to produce very accurate prediction from data.},

This paper introduces a Graph-based Collaborative Filtering Category Recommendation (GCFCR) system as a first step in modelling the financial domain as an inter-connected, heterogeneous, dynamic system of nodes and edges. The goal of this paper is to identify customer interest based on the neighborhood of each node and make personalized suggestions or identify relevant content for each customer. Matching relevant products and services to customers is a key foundation of building and maintaining strong customer relationships, facilitating more personalized marketing which can ultimately result in increased customer activity, trust, and revenue.

abstract = {The authors present a virtual authoring environment for artistic creation in VR. It enables the effortless conversion of 2D images into volumetric 3D objects. Artistic elements in the input material are extracted with a convenient VR-based segmentation tool. Relief sculpting is then performed by interactively mixing different height maps. These are automatically generated from the input image structure and appearance. A prototype of the tool is showcased in an analog-virtual artistic workflow in collaboration with a traditional painter. It combines the expressiveness of analog painting and sculpting with the creative freedom of spatial arrangement in VR.},

abstract = {Hospitals can supply clinical decision support systems with electronic healthcare record provided by different users and stored in different computer systems. This way, during a diagnosis decision a user can be supported by a remote knowledge database constructed by other users, like, for instance, a reference specialist discussion board. Usually, medical applications scenarios like this use different terminology systems leading to terminological interoperability problems. Still, clinical applications frequently make use of different clinical ontology systems that do not provide semantic types necessary to create a structure to carry shared knowledge database. The lack of this semantic types brings ontology interoperability problems which difficult the support of collaborative clinical decision-making. This paper presents a UMLS interoperable solution to promote clinical applications development intended to contribute with collaborative diagnosis decision, in a distributed computer environment based on service-oriented architecture. This paper still presents a case study to demonstrate DDSOnt usability through the development of a system prototype integrated to a collaborative and multimedia communication distance-learning environment.},

abstract = {According to the taxonomy for agent activity, proposed by V. Parunak, a collaboration is an interaction between agents of a multi-agent system (MAS) whereby the agents explicitly coordinate their actions before they cooperate. We discuss two sub-types of collaboration in the context of situated MASs, namely asynchronous and synchronous collaboration. After setting up collaboration, the interaction between the agents in an asynchronous collaboration happens indirectly through the environment. Agents direct their actions via the perceived state change of their environment. On the other hand, during a synchronous collaboration agents have to act simultaneously and this requires an additional agreement about which actions should be executed. Although they both fit the characteristics of collaboration, the requirements for their implementation is quite different. Whereas agents in an asynchronous collaboration can be implemented as separate processes that act directly into the environment, the implementation of synchronous collaboration is more complex since it requires support for simultaneous actions. In the paper we give examples of both kinds of collaborations and outline the necessary support for their implementation.},

abstract = {Collaboration among research scientists across multiple types of visualizations and platforms is useful to enhance scientific workflow and lead to unique analysis and discovery. However, current analytic tools and visualization infrastructure lack sufficient capabilities to fully support collaboration across multiple types of visualizations, display/interactive systems, and geographically distributed researchers. We have combined, adapted, and enhanced several emerging immersive and visualization technologies into a novel collaboration system that will provide scientists with the ability to connect with other scientists to work together across multiple visualization platforms (i.e. stereoscopic versus monoscopic), multiple datasets (i.e. 3-Dimensional versus 2-Dimensional data), and multiple visualization techniques (i.e. volumetric rendering versus 2D plots). We have demonstrated several use cases of this system in materials science, manufacturing, planning, and others. In one such use case, our collaboration system imports material science data (i.e., graphite billet) and enable multiple scientists to analyze and explore the density change of graphite across immersive and non-immersive systems, which will help to understand the potential structural problem in it. We recruited scientists that work with the datasets we demonstrate in three use case scenarios and conducted an experimental user study to evaluate our novel collaboration system on scientific visualization workflow effectiveness. In this paper, we present the results on task completion time, task performance, user experience, and feedback among multiple and feedback among multiple geographically distributed collaborators using different multiple-platform for collaboration.},

The hypothesis was that users would tune into each other and have sections of characteristic rhythmical relationships that related to the ground rhythm. Results from interaction data show that teams did find a mutual rhythm, and that they were able to keep this rhythm for a while and/or over several small periods. Results also showed that two players engaged in very specific rhythmical relationships that differed from each other. Video analysis of user interaction shines light upon how users engaged in a rhythmical relationship, and interviews give information about the user experience in terms of the game play and user collaboration. Based on the findings in this paper we propose design guidelines for collaborative rhythmical game play.},

However, the extent to which these models offer effective and accurate information remains unverified. In collaboration with registered dietitians (RDs), we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in providing accurate and personalized nutrition information. Through a mixed-methods approach, RDs validated GPT-4 outputs at various levels of prompt specificity, which led to the development of design guidelines used to prompt LLMs for nutrition information. We tested these guidelines by creating a GPT prototype, The Food Product Nutrition Assistant, tailored for food product explanations. This prototype was refined and evaluated in focus groups with RDs. We find that the implementation of these dietitian-reviewed template instructions enhance the generation of detailed food product descriptions and tailored nutrition information.},

In this paper we present two studies aimed at comparing how a collaborative interactive experience based on two different interaction paradigms -one based on Full-Body Interaction and the other on Desktop computer interaction- may impact the socio-affective aspects of collaboration as part of a learning process in children. Our results show that Full-Body Interaction had a highly significant impact on how the participating children perceived collaboration in small groups and on how they felt about the other children in the group. This indicates that Full-Body Interaction may be beneficial for supporting the construction of a positive social space for collaborative learning, given its potential to enable the use of embodied resources, which are fundamental for social communication and social cognition.},

abstract = {When collaborating face-to-face, people commonly use the surfaces and spaces around them to perform sensemaking tasks, such as spatially organising documents, notes or images. However, when people collaborate remotely using desktop interfaces they no longer feel like they are sharing the same space. This limitation may be overcome through collaboration in immersive environments, which simulate the physical in-person experience. In this paper, we report on a between-groups study comparing collaborations on image organisation tasks, in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment to more conventional desktop conferencing. Collecting data from 40 subjects in groups of four, we measured task performance, user behaviours, collaboration engagement and awareness. Overall, the VR and desktop interface resulted in similar speed, accuracy and social presence rating, but we observed more conversations and interaction with objects, and more equal contributions to the interaction from participants within groups in VR. We also identified differences in coordination and collaborative awareness behaviours between VR and desktop platforms. We report on a set of systematic measures for assessing VR collaborative experience and a new analysis tool that we have developed to capture user behaviours in collaborative setting. Finally, we provide design considerations and directions for future work.},

abstract = {We present a mixed-reality system for remote collaborations, where collaborators can discuss, explore, create and learn about 3D physical objects. The system combines Hololens augmented reality, 3D Kinect cameras, PC and virtual reality interfaces, into a virtual space that hosts remote collaborators, and physical &amp; virtual objects.When talented people have access to fabrication tools and expertise, incredible inventions can be manifested to solve local and global problems. Because of this, the “maker movement” is a growing phenomenon, manifested through the increased number of maker spaces in many affluent communities. However, many talented individuals lack access to resources in their local communities, and collaboration opportunities with remote experts are wasted due to the limitations of current teleconferencing systems. We present a mixed-reality (MR) system for enabling remote collaborations in the context of maker activities, that allows groups of students and instructors to discuss, explore, create and learn about physical objects. The system combines augmented reality (AR) headsets, 3D cameras, PC and virtual reality (VR) interfaces, into a virtual space that contains multiple remote students, instructors, physical and virtual objects. Remote students can see a real-time 3D scan of the on-site user's physical environment, and the virtual avatars of other students. The system can support learning and exploration by showing virtual overlays on real objects (ex: showing a physical robot's sensor data or internal circuitry) while responding to real-time manipulation of physical objects by the on-site user; and can support design activities by allowing remote and local participants to annotate physical objects with virtual drawings and virtual models. This platform is being developed as an open-source project, and we are currently building applications with the intention to deploy in hybrid makerspace classrooms involving on-site and remote students.},

abstract = {Many Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are composed of low-cost devices that are deeply integrated with physical environments. As a result, the performance of a CPS system is inevitably undermined by various physical uncertainties, which include stochastic noises, hardware biases, unpredictable environment changes, and dynamics of the physical process of interest. Traditional solutions to these issues (e.g., device calibration and collaborative signal processing) work in an open-loop fashion and hence often fail to adapt to the uncertainties after system deployment. In this article, we propose an adaptive system-level calibration approach for a class of CPS systems whose primary objective is to detect events or targets of interest. Through collaborative data fusion, our calibration approach features a feedback control loop that exploits system heterogeneity to mitigate the impact of aforementioned uncertainties on the system performance. In contrast to existing heuristic-based solutions, our control-theoretical calibration algorithm can ensure provable system stability and convergence. We also develop a routing algorithm for fusion-based multihop CPS systems that is robust to communication unreliability and delay. Our approach is evaluated by both experiments on a testbed of Tmotes as well as extensive simulations based on data traces gathered from a real vehicle detection experiment. The results demonstrate that our calibration algorithm enables a CPS system to maintain the optimal sensing performance in the presence of various system and environmental dynamics.},

abstract = {In recent years, much work in K-12 educational technology has shifted away from addressing the problem of mere accessibility and toward a greater emphasis on the effective design of learning environments that make innovative use of emerging digital technologies. Contemporary research in the Learning Sciences reveals the importance of well-designed, student-centered learning environments that are situated in an appropriate context; engage today's participatory culture; speak to 21st century literacies; and enable collaborative, distributed and embodied cognition. Recent research in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) community has yielded tools and paradigms to enable collaboration, embodied interaction, and multimodal interaction within computational frameworks.Looking across these disciplines we have identified three key areas of convergent research that, when applied to the design of interactive learning environments, can yield truly transformative results: embodiment, computational mediation, and multimodality. By embodiment we mean interactions that engage students both in mind and body, encouraging them to physically explore concepts and systems by moving within and acting upon an environment. By computational mediation we mean that students interact with computational technology that monitors their actions and provides real-time feedback with respect to those actions. By multimodality we mean interactions that encompass students' full sensory and expressive capabilities including visual, sonic, and kinesthetic.Despite this promise, three significant challenges can prevent such work from achieving a broad impact in real world contexts. First, due to their cost and complexity, many emerging interactive environments remain sequestered in specialized facilities, inaccessible to the students and educators who might benefit most. Conversely, many web-based and desktop applications that can readily scale to large user groups, fail to engage the capabilities of learners due to the limiting nature of the mouse/keyboard interface. Finally, all too often, educators and media designers fail to deeply collaborate. As a consequence, researchers are left to make design decisions that are not rooted in an appropriate theoretical base and educators are offered unwieldy tools that do not address the needs of their students.Our work (http://ame2.asu.edu/projects/emlearning) represents a significant advance in the domain of technology-enabled K-12 learning through the purposeful integration of the trans-disciplinary research described above. Specifically:• We have developed the Situated Multimedia Arts Learning Lab [SMALLab], a mixed-reality learning environment that allows learners to engage through full body 3D movements and gestures within a collaborative, computationally mediated space. SMALLab enables emerging interactive learning approaches to reach a broad population of students and educators in a low cost package.• We are guided by a grounded design approach to the collaborative design of learning scenarios that features ongoing, deep collaboration through a professional learning community comprised of a cohort of K-12 teachers, students, media researchers, and artists.},

abstract = {The unprecedented growth of online citizen science projects provides growing opportunities for the public to participate in scientific discoveries. Nevertheless, volunteers typically make only a few contributions before exiting the system. Thus a significant challenge to such systems is increasing the capacity and efficiency of volunteers without hindering their motivation and engagement. To address this challenge, we study the role of incorporating collaborative agents in the existing workflow of a citizen science project for the purpose of increasing the capacity and efficiency of these systems, while maintaining the motivation of participants in the system. Our new enhanced workflow combines human-machine collaboration in two ways: Humans can aid the machine in solving more difficult tasks with high information value, while the machine can facilitate human engagement by generating motivational messages that emphasize different aspects of human-machine collaboration. We implemented this workflow in a study comprising thousands of volunteers in Galaxy Zoo, one of the largest citizen science projects on the web. Volunteers could choose to use the enhanced workflow or the existing workflow in which users did not receive motivational messages, and tasks were allocated to volunteers sequentially without regard to information value. We found that the volunteers working in the enhanced workflow were more productive than those volunteers who worked in the existing workflow, without incurring a loss in the quality of their contributions. Additionally, in the enhanced workflow, the type of messages used had a profound effect on volunteer performance. Our work demonstrates the importance of varying human-machine collaboration models in citizen science.},

abstract = {Trusted execution environment (TEE) technology has found many applications in mitigating various security risks in an efficient manner, which is attractive for critical infrastructure protection. First, the natural of critical infrastructure requires it to be well protected from various cyber attacks. Second, performance is usually important for critical infrastructure and it cannot afford an expensive protection mechanism. While a large number of TEE-based critical infrastructure protection systems have been proposed to address various security challenges (e.g., secure sensing and reliable control), most existing works ignore one important feature, i.e., devices comprised the critical infrastructure may be equipped with multiple incompatible TEE technologies and belongs to different owners. This feature makes it hard for these devices to establish mutual trust and form a unified TEE environment. To address these challenges and fully unleash the potential of TEE technology for critical infrastructure protection, we propose DHTee, a decentralized coordination mechanism. DHTee uses blockchain technology to support key TEE functions in a heterogeneous TEE environment, especially the attestation service. A Device equipped with one TEE can interact securely with the blockchain to verify whether another potential collaborating device claiming to have a different TEE meets the security requirements. DHTee is also flexible and can support new TEE schemes without affecting devices using existing TEEs that have been supported by the system.},

DIEL exploits the social translucence concept in order to create a virtual and dynamic learning space where community members can easily interact while implementing any social constructivist learning paradigm. Moreover, an audio-video chat is as well seamlessly integrated, to serve as an orthogonal support for collaboration, for "face-to-face-like" interactions. The combination of the two approaches benefits the users' experience in the exploitation of proximity relationships with respect to other users and resources, to simplify and stimulate collaborative activities.},

abstract = {In the Space domain the High Level Architecture (HLA) is one of the reference standard for Distributed Simulation. However, for the different organization involved in the Space domain (e.g. NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and JAXA) and their industrial partners, it is difficult to implement HLA simulators (called Federates) able to interact and interoperate in the context of a distributed HLA simulation (called Federation). The lack of a common FOM (Federation Object Model) for the Space domain is one of the main reasons that precludes a-priori interoperability between heterogeneous federates. To fill this lack a Product Development Group (PDG) has been recently activated in the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) with the aim to provide a Space Reference FOM (SRFOM) for international collaboration on Space systems simulations. Members of the PDG come from several countries and contribute experiences from projects within NASA, ESA and other organizations. Participants represent government, academia and industry. The paper presents an overview of the ongoing Space Reference FOM standardization initiative by focusing on the solution provided for managing the execution of an SRFOM-based Federation.},

abstract = {Drones are flying machines which can be employed for sensing in different altitudes. While past research has made remarkable progress in providing autonomous drone navigation, the integration of humans and drones to collaboratively solve a task poses new challenges. Studies are needed to understand the crucial features of systems that integrate autonomous drone behavior and human-drone interactions. In this work, we study the performance of such a networked system for human-drone teams. We make use of a prototype consisting of an off-the-shelf drone with an on-board camera, autopilot, and Wi-Fi connectivity, and a custom smartphone app. The app supports the drone and performs vision-based autonomous navigation control and human gesture recognition, and provides a graphical user interface for the human. To study the benefit of collaboration, a concrete indoor use case is selected, namely book-shelf inventory. The drone scans the books in a shelf, while the human acts as a supervisor who may temporarily take over control to reposition the drone. In a measurement study, we investigate the command response delays of the networked system, effects of human intervention, and the performance of gesture-based interaction.},

abstract = {Providing an integrated access to multiple heterogeneous sources is a challenging issue in global information systems for cooperation and interoperability. In this context, two fundamental problems arise. First, how to determine if the sources contain semantically related information, that is, information related to the same or similar real-world concept(s). Second, how to handle semantic heterogeneity to support integration and uniform query interfaces. Complicating factors with respect to conventional view integration techniques are related to the fact that the sources to be integrated already exist and that semantic heterogeneity occurs on the large-scale, involving terminology, structure, and context of the involved sources, with respect to geographical, organizational, and functional aspects related to information use. Moreover, to meet the requirements of global, Internet-based information systems, it is important that tools developed for supporting these activities are semi-automatic and scalable as much as possible.The goal of this paper is to describe the MOMIS [4, 5] (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple Information Sources) approach to the integration and query of multiple, heterogeneous information sources, containing structured and semistructured data. MOMIS has been conceived as a joint collaboration between University of Milano and Modena in the framework of the INTERDATA national research project, aiming at providing methods and tools for data management in Internet-based information systems. Like other integration projects [1, 10, 14], MOMIS follows a “semantic approach” to information integration based on the conceptual schema, or metadata, of the information sources, and on the following architectural elements: i) a common object-oriented data model, defined according to the ODLI3 language, to describe source schemas for integration purposes.  The data model and ODLI3 have been defined in MOMIS as subset of the ODMG-93 ones, following the proposal for a standard mediator language developed by the I3/POB working group [7]. In addition, ODLI3 introduces new constructors to support the semantic integration process [4, 5]; ii) one or more wrappers, to translate schema descriptions into the common ODLI3 representation; iii) a mediator and a query-processing component, based on two pre-existing tools, namely ARTEMIS [8] and ODB-Tools [3] (available on Internet at http://sparc20.dsi.unimo.it/), to provide an I3 architecture for integration and query optimization. In this paper, we focus on capturing and reasoning about semantic aspects of schema descriptions of heterogeneous information sources for supporting integration and query optimization. Both semistructured and structured data sources are taken into account [5]. A Common Thesaurus is constructed, which has the role of a shared ontology for the information sources. The Common Thesaurus is built by analyzing ODLI3 descriptions of the sources, by exploiting the Description Logics OLCD (Object Language with Complements allowing Descriptive cycles) [2, 6], derived from KL-ONE family [17]. The knowledge in the Common Thesaurus is then exploited for the identification of semantically related information in ODLI3 descriptions of different sources and for their integration at the global level. Mapping rules and integrity constraints are defined at the global level to express the relationships holding between the integrated description and the sources descriptions.  ODB-Tools, supporting OLCD and description logic inference techniques, allows the analysis of sources descriptions for generating a consistent Common Thesaurus and provides support for semantic optimization of queries at the global level, based on defined mapping rules and integrity constraints.},

Three different prototypes for Google Glass render the current state of the system in the form of text, icons or a traffic light.

abstract = {We describe a prototype virtual reality teleconferencing system called MASSIVE which has been developed as part of our on-going research into collaborative virtual environments. This system allows multiple users to communicate using arbitrary combinations of audio, graphics, and text media over local and wide area networks. Communication is controlled by a so-called spatial model of interaction so that one user's perception of another user is sensitive to their relative positions and orientations. The key concept in this spatial model is the (quantitative) awareness which one object has of another. This is controlled by the observing object's focus and the observed object's nimbus, which describe regions of interest and projection, respectively. Each object's aura defines the total region within which it interacts. This is applied independently in each medium. The system (and the spatial model which it implements) is intended to provide a flexible and natural environment for the spatial mediation of conversation. The model also provides a basis for scaling to relatively large numbers of users. Our design goals include supporting heterogeneity, scalability, spatial mediation, balance of power, and multiple concurrent meetings; MASSIVE meets all of these goals. Our initial experiences show the importance of audio in collaborative VR, and they raise issues about field of view for graphical users, speed of navigation, quality of embodiment, varying perceptions of space, and scalability.},

abstract = {We present Socialite, a novel end user programming tool for the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). SIoT is a new paradigm where IoT merges with social networks, allowing people and connected devices as well as the devices themselves to interact within a social network framework. Through an online survey with 60 potential users, we identified eight desired features for the SIoT, which were then clustered into four rule categories that can be programmed by end users and/or imposed by systems. The rules created by end users are used to reason about both devices and people in their social relationships to support automated decisions during runtime. Socialite uses ontology/semantic models for basic/low-level knowledge representation (e.g., device and user) to encapsulate the heterogeneity in devices from various manufacturers, and uses production rules (trigger-action programming) for high-level reasoning. With the ontology model, our reasoning supports both device type automation (e.g., current temperature from a thermostat) and capability-based automation (e.g., current temperature from any devices with the same capability). Furthermore, the Socialite rules leverage social relationships and device capabilities to facilitate collaboration by efficiently sharing configuration and information among users/friends and even with devices from people unknown to a user. In a 24-participant user study (12 with no programming experience), we found that Socialite was easy to learn and use, for both programmers and non-programmers. Participants were able to create automation based rules, social relationship involved rules, as well rules they created during the study.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) refers to the paradigm of learning models over a collaborative research network involving multiple clients without sacrificing privacy. Recently, there have been rising concerns on the distributional discrepancies across different clients, which could even cause counterproductive consequences when collaborating with others. While it is not necessarily that collaborating with all clients will achieve the best performance, in this paper, we study a rational collaboration called "collaboration equilibrium'' (CE), where smaller collaboration coalitions are formed. Each client collaborates with certain members who maximally improve the model learning and isolates the others who make little contribution. We propose the concept of benefit graph which describes how each client can benefit from collaborating with other clients and advance a Pareto optimization approach to identify the optimal collaborators. Then we theoretically prove that we can reach a CE from the benefit graph through an iterative graph operation. Our framework provides a new way of setting up collaborations in a research network. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

(www.mum2008.org/ )Multimedia is becoming ubiquitous and we already now and/or soon will be able access any multimedia content, from anywhere in the world, on any device. This conference addresses this theme and looks at the current cutting-edge technologies enabling mobile and ubiquitous multimedia. MUM 2008 targets novel and forward looking research that focuses on the architectures, protocols, and algorithms to cope with mobility. MUM2008 is also targeting case studies, field trials, and evaluation of new applications and services, as well as research in novel mobile user interfaces, research in design and use of intelligent, aware, proactive, and attentive environments. MUM 2008 is also a conference focused on research in middleware and distributed-computing support for mobile and ubiquitous multimedia, mobile computer graphics, games, and entertainment, mobile and ubiquitous multimedia in intelligent transportation systems. Finally, MUM2008 is also focusing on research in novel adaptive, context-aware, and wireless multimedia applications and systems, mobile media management and mobile and ubiquitous multimedia in ad hoc networks. Overall, MUM2008 is about the trends, major challenges, and perspectives related to mobile and ubiquitous multimedia.This year the MUM conference is organized in collaboration between Ume\r{a} university and Lule\r{a} University of Technology, and in cooperation (In-Coop) with ACM SigMobile at Ume\r{a} university, 3--5 Dec 2008, Ume\r{a}, Sweden.MUM 2008 is a leading annual international conference, which provides a forum for presenting the latest research results on mobile and ubiquitous multimedia, and previous conference venues include: Oulu, FIN (2007), Stanford, USA (2006), Christchurch, NZ (2005), College Park, USA (2004), Norrk\"{o}ping, SWE (2003) and Oulu, FIN (2002).The conference's call-for-papers resulted in forty five submissions from seventeen countries. These were subject to a rigorous review procedure. Every paper had three or four independent reviews. Twenty regular papers from both academia and industry were selected for publication in this volume of proceedings making the selection rate 42%. Regular papers were allocated up to 8 pages in ACM double column format each. Further selection process identified seven short papers for publication (up to 4 pages each) and presentation based on their work-in-progress. Then a separate process has identified 6 papers with industry focus. The presentations of the selected papers are organized in nine sessions as reflected in the table of content:•Ubiquitous interaction and ubiquitous multimedia•Smart multimedia applications and services•Sharing and management of multimedia in heterogeneous networks•Context-aware multimedia applications and services•User-centric mobile multimedia•Wireless multimedia networking•Mobile and ubiquitous applications --- 1•Mobile and ubiquitous applications --- 2•Industrial paper sessionWhile keeping the single-track tradition of the technical program of the MUM conferences, MUM2008 program includes two tutorials during morning of the first day of the conference. These tutorials are given by experts in the field and present state-of-the-art achievement. In particular, Prof Timo Ojala from the University of Oulu will present "Theories and case studies on mobile interactive system design and evaluation", while Prof Kostas Pentikousis will present "Mobility and Multiaccess in Emerging Internet Architectures".This year the MUM2008 conference has two distinguished keynote speakers. First keynote speaker comes from telecommunications industry --- Mr Martin K\"{o}rling, Director, Service layer research, Ericsson Research. A second keynote speaker comes from academia --- Prof. Rikard Lindgren, University of Gothenburg. Such a balance of industry and academia is indicative of how the area of mobile and ubiquitous multimedia spans across academic research as well as extending to commercial applications and industrial R&amp;D. Another indication of industry support is the sponsorship that we have received for the organization of MUM'08 from Ericsson and Nokia, two leading international companies in Scandinavia with strong interest and involvement in digital technologies for enabling mobile and ubiquitous multimedia.We hope this conference will steer exciting and fruitful discussions, new ideas, new collaborations, and new ways of thinking about, and approaching the field of mobile and ubiquitous multimedia.},

However, there is a fundamental gap that arises from the difference in the degree to which remote and local workers interact with virtual and physical objects, which is attributed to differing senses of ownership over these objects. Addressing this gap, my thesis investigates how collaborative functionality affects psychological ownership in shared AR workspaces. Specifically, the study examines how the ability to modify annotations shapes Individual and Collective Psychological Ownership (IPO and CPO). Furthermore, I explore how IPO and CPO mediate the effect of collaborative functionality on the outcomes of remote collaboration. My overall goal is to extend the theoretical understanding of psychological ownership, offering insights into the dynamics of shared AR environments by focusing on the interplay between physical and virtual elements.},

abstract = {A collective intelligence application is one that harnesses the knowledge and work of its users to provide the data for the application and to improve its usefulness. The most hyped examples of collective intelligence applications have been labeled as "Web 2.0" applications. Web 2.0 is an amorphous term used to define a computing paradigm that uses the Web as the application platform and facilitates collaboration and information sharing between users. Classic examples of Web 2.0 applications include: wikis, blogs (or Weblogs), social network services, and social bookmarking.Collective intelligence is not a new concept. As long ago as 1968, computer visionaries foresaw the ability of computers to be applied to cooperation in creative endeavors by allowing people capable of solving specific problems to share their ideas. However, collective intelligence has been gaining momentum as new tools supporting collaboration have become available. The concept of collective intelligence is now being explored by businesses interested in using it for collaborative innovation and by researchers interested in addressing systemic problems like climate change.Collective intelligence is a fundamentally different way of viewing how applications can support human interaction and decision making. Most traditional applications have focused in improving the productivity or decision making of the individual user. The emphasis has been on providing the tools and data necessary to fulfill a specific job function. Under the collective intelligence paradigm, the focus is on harnessing the intelligence of groups of people to enable greater productivity and better decisions than are possible by individuals working in isolation.The shift to a collective intelligence paradigm requires software developers to have different ways of thinking about how their how software might be used and what features would enable better visualization and use of information among groups of people. The new breed of collective intelligence applications needs to center around user defined data that can be reused to support decision making, team building, or to improve understanding of the world around us. The users of these systems should play a central role in defining what data is important and how the data is used. The essential features of collective intelligence applications are similar to the design patterns for Web 2.0 applications except that collective intelligence applications can be custom applications designed for small highly specialized domains instead of the larger Web audience served by most Web 2.0 applications. The seven principle collective intelligence application requirements are (adapted from O'Reilly):1. Task specific representations: Domain specific collective intelligence applications should support views of the task that are tailored to the particular domain.2. Data is the key: Collective intelligence applications are data centric and should be designed to collect and share data among users.3. Users add value: Users of collective intelligence applications know the most about the value of the information it contains. The application should provide mechanisms for them to add to, modify, or otherwise enhance the data to improve its usefulness.4. Facilitate data aggregation: The ability to aggregate data adds value. Collective intelligence applications should be designed such that data aggregation occurs naturally through regular use.5. Facilitate data access: The data in collective intelligence applications can have use beyond the boundaries of the application. Collective intelligence applications should offer Web services interfaces and other mechanisms to facilitate the re-use of data.6. Facilitate access for all devices: The PC is no longer the only access device for internet applications. Collective intelligence applications need to be designed to integrate services across handheld devices, PCs, and internet servers.7. The perpetual beta: Collective intelligence applications are ongoing services provided to its users thus new features should be added on a regular basis based on the changing needs of the user community.The processes involved in designing and implementing specialized collective intelligence applications are discussed below in the context of DDtrac, a Web-based application that allows for the easy collection and summary of special education data.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous communicating systems have particular characteristics, such as their dynamic nature and the great number of users and heterogeneous devices involved. In our work, we focus on collaborative activities. For such activities, users are organized into groups and communicate in order to achieve a common goal. Therefore, the problem of designing and implementing collaborative applications on top of ubiquitous communicating systems is a complex task that requires adequate modeling. In our view, addressing this problem needs a model-driven approach in order to ensure the coherence and correctness of the built systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-level modeling approach for collaborative ubiquitous systems. Moreover, relevant abstraction levels are identified and means are provided for inter-level model transformation (refinement) and for adaptation to context changes (selection). This adaptation is guided by both high level requirements and low level constraints.},

abstract = {Collaboration and information sharing between organizations that share a common goal is becoming increasingly important. Effective sharing promotes efficiency and productivity as well as enhances customer service. With Internet connectivity widely available, sharing and access to information is relatively simple to implement. However, the abundance causes another problem - the difficulty of determining where truly useful and relevant information is housed. Information resources, such as data, documents, multimedia objects and services stored in different agencies need to be easily discovered and shared. We propose a collaborative semantic and pragmatic annotation environment where resources of each agency can be annotated by users in the government social network. This collaborative annotation captures not only the semantics but also the pragmatics of the resources, such as who, when, where, how and why the resources are used. The benefits of semantic and pragmatic annotation tags will include an ability to filter, discover and search new and dynamic as well as hidden resources, to navigate between resources in a search by traversing semantic relationships, and to recommend the most relevant government information distributed over different agencies. A distributed architecture of a tagging system is shown and tag-based search is illustrated.},

abstract = {Developing cross-device multi-user interfaces (UIs) is a challenging problem. There are numerous ways in which content and interactivity can be distributed. However, good solutions must consider multiple users, their roles, their preferences and access rights, as well as device capabilities. Manual and rule-based solutions are tedious to create and do not scale to larger problems nor do they adapt to dynamic changes, such as users leaving or joining an activity. In this paper, we cast the problem of UI distribution as an assignment problem and propose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. We present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time applications in dynamically changing collaborative settings. It optimizes the allocation of UI elements based on device capabilities, user roles, preferences, and access rights. We present a proof-of-concept designer-in-the-loop tool, allowing for quick solution exploration. Finally, we compare our approach to traditional paper prototyping in a lab study.},

abstract = {Mobile digital assistants such as Microsoft Cortana and Google Now currently offer appealing proactive experiences to users, which aim to deliver the right information at the right time. To achieve this goal, it is crucial to precisely predict users' real-time intent. Intent is closely related to context, which includes not only the spatial-temporal information but also users' current activities that can be sensed by mobile devices. The relationship between intent and context is highly dynamic and exhibits chaotic sequential correlation. The context itself is often sparse and heterogeneous. The dynamics and co-movement among contextual signals are also elusive and complicated. Traditional recommendation models cannot directly apply to proactive experiences because they fail to tackle the above challenges. Inspired by the nowcasting practice in meteorology and macroeconomics, we propose an innovative collaborative nowcasting model to effectively resolve these challenges. The proposed model successfully addresses sparsity and heterogeneity of contextual signals. It also effectively models the convoluted correlation within contextual signals and between context and intent. Specifically, the model first extracts collaborative latent factors, which summarize shared temporal structural patterns in contextual signals, and then exploits the collaborative Kalman Filter to generate serially correlated personalized latent factors, which are utilized to monitor each user's real-time intent. Extensive experiments with real-world data sets from a commercial digital assistant demonstrate the effectiveness of the collaborative nowcasting model. The studied problem and model provide inspiring implications for new paradigms of recommendations on mobile intelligent devices.},

In contrast, we propose a Mixed Reality (MR) system that shares with the remote helper, not only 3D captured environment data but also real-time orientation info of the worker's viewpoint. We conducted a pilot study to evaluate the usability of the system, and we found that extra synchronized orientation data can make collaborators feel more connected spatially and mentally.},

abstract = {Multi-modal recommendation systems, which integrate diverse types of information, have gained widespread attention in recent years. However, compared to traditional collaborative filtering-based multi-modal recommendation systems, research on multi-modal sequential recommendation is still in its nascent stages. Unlike traditional sequential recommendation models that solely rely on item identifier (ID) information and focus on network structure design, multi-modal recommendation models need to emphasize item representation learning and the fusion of heterogeneous data sources. This paper investigates the impact of item representation learning on downstream recommendation tasks and examines the disparities in information fusion at different stages. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the need to design a framework suitable for collaborative learning and fusion of diverse information. Based on this, we propose a new model-agnostic framework for multi-modal sequential recommendation tasks, called Online Distillation-enhanced Multi-modal Transformer (ODMT), to enhance feature interaction and mutual learning among multi-source input (ID, text, and image), while avoiding conflicts among different features during training, thereby improving recommendation accuracy. To be specific, we first introduce an ID-aware Multi-modal Transformer module in the item representation learning stage to facilitate information interaction among different features. Secondly, we employ an online distillation training strategy in the prediction optimization stage to make multi-source data learn from each other and improve prediction robustness. Experimental results on a stream media recommendation dataset and three e-commerce recommendation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two modules, which is approximately 10% improvement in performance compared to baseline models. Our code will be released at: https://github.com/xyliugo/ODMT.},

The expert's hand gesture is captured with a hand tracking device and visualized with a rigged 3D hand model on the live video feed. The system can be accessed via a web browser, and it does not require any app software to be installed on the customer's device.

abstract = {Solving complex real-world grand challenge problems requires in-depth collaboration of researchers from multiple disciplines. Such collaboration often involves harnessing multiscale and multi-dimensional data and combining models from different fields to simulate systems. However, the progress on this front has been limited mainly due to significant gaps in domain knowledge and tools that are typically employed in silos of the domains. Researchers from different fields face considerable barriers to understanding and reusing each other’s data/models in order to collaborate effectively. For example, in solving the global sustainability problems, researchers from hydrology, climate science, agriculture, and economics need to run their respective models to study different components of the global and local food, energy and water systems while, at the same time, need to interact with other researchers and integrate the results of one model with another. Developing this kind of model coupling workflow calls for (1) a large amount of data being processed and exchanged across domains and organizations, (2) identifying and processing the output of one model to make it ready for integration into another model, (3) controlling the workflow dynamically so that it runs until a certain convergence condition or other criteria is met, and (4) close collaboration among the modelers to explore, tune, and test the configuration and data transformation needed to link the models. We have developed C3F, a flexible collaborative model coupling framework to help researchers accelerate their model integration and linking efforts by leveraging advanced cyberinfrastructure such as high-performance computing and virtual containers. In this paper, we describe our experience and lessons learned in developing this cyberinfrastructure solution to support the linking of Water Balance Model (WBM) and SIMPLE-G agricultural economic model in an NSF funded INFEWS project and a DOE-funded Program on Coupled Human and Earth Systems (PCHES) to study the implications of groundwater scarcity for food-energy-water systems. The C3F model coupling framework can be extended to facilitate other model linkages as well.},

abstract = {Although searching is often seen as a solitary activity, searching in collaboration with others is deemed useful or necessary in many complex situations such as: travel planning; online shopping; looking for health related information; planning birthday parties; working on a group project; or finding a house to buy. Researchers have found that complex search tasks can be executed more effectively and efficiently, achieve higher material coverage, and enable higher knowledge gains in an explicit collaborative setting than if conducted in isolation. However, even though researchers have carefully designed several Collaborative Search user studies, there is still conflicting evidence or a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of collaborative search systems. Thus, in this thesis, we focus on examining the effectiveness of collaborative search systems in two parts.In the first part, we shed light on the effectiveness of collaborative search systems to support two group configurations, namely group sizes and users' roles.In the second part of this thesis, we make our group configurations constant, particularly, group sizes are set to up to three people, and group members receive the same role. We then turn to a different perspective and focus on examining the effectiveness in two contexts: Search as Learning and collaborative online shopping.Awarded by: Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands on 24 February 2022.Supervised by: Claudia Hauff.Available at: https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:9f8f9ffc-c3d9-4583-8903-25889233a95b.},

abstract = {Nowadays, end users can personalize their smart devices and web applications by defining or reusing IF-THEN rules through dedicated End-User Development (EUD) tools. Despite apparent simplicity, such tools present their own set of issues. The emerging and increasing complexity of the Internet of Things, for example, is barely taken into account, and the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions of different smart devices and web applications is continuously growing. Such a large design space makes end-user personalization a complex task for non-programmers, and motivates the need of assisting users in easily discovering and managing rules and functionality, e.g., through recommendation techniques. In this article, we tackle the emerging problem of recommending IF-THEN rules to end users by presenting RecRules, a hybrid and semantic recommendation system. Through a mixed content and collaborative approach, the goal of RecRules is to recommend by functionality: it suggests rules based on their final purposes, thus overcoming details like manufacturers and brands. The algorithm uses a semantic reasoning process to enrich rules with semantic information, with the aim of uncovering hidden connections between rules in terms of shared functionality. Then, it builds a collaborative semantic graph, and it exploits different types of path-based features to train a learning to rank algorithm and compute top-N recommendations. We evaluate RecRules through different experiments on real user data extracted from IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD tools. Results are promising: they show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms and open the way for a new class of recommender systems for EUD that take into account the actual functionality needed by end users.},

abstract = {Systems-of-Systems (SoS) refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, sometimes distributed and found in critical application domains. The independence of constituent systems brings big challenges to design SoS software architectures. Such architectures must be dynamic, evolve along the time, and allow the execution of, sometimes unknown in design time, emergent behaviours to accomplish SoS missions. Moreover, SoS architectures must connect heterogeneous systems, making possible their communication, coordination, and collaboration in a seamless way. In another perspective, mediators are architectural elements that enable required interactions among heterogeneous software entities. Despite the benefits offered by mediators, mainly at overcoming interoperability issues of software systems, no investigation has been made about which mediators can be used in SoS architectures to address challenges imposed by the nature of such heterogeneous, distributed and complex software-intensive systems. The main contribution of this paper is a taxonomy of software mediators that can be used by software architects as a library of solutions when designing their SoS. Twelve types of mediators in three categories are proposed allowing capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems' interactions, and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through the mediation infrastructure. This taxonomy was established based on knowledge and experience from other types of complex systems that use mediators, and authors previous experience at architecting SoS. Categories in the taxonomy were defined based on the intrinsic characteristics of SoS architectures and well-established architectural patterns and styles. To observe the feasibility of this taxonomy, the software architecture of a Flood Monitoring System-of-Systems (FMSoS) was established using mediators as first-class software entities. Based on FMSoS architecture it was possible to have preliminary evidence to conclude that, architectures containing the proposed mediators are low coupled, support dynamic configurations during the SoS execution, and are able to address quality attributes such as flexibility, scalability, and interoperability.},

abstract = {As collaborative technologies evolve from supportive tools to interactive teammates, there is a growing need to understand how trust and team processes develop in human-agent teams. To contribute effectively, these systems must be able to support human teammates in a task without disrupting the delicate interpersonal states and team processes that govern successful collaboration. In order to break down the complexity of monitoring multiple actors in human-agent collaborations, there is a need to identify interpretable, generalizable measures that can monitor the emergence of interpersonal and team-level processes that underlie effective teaming. We address this gap by using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy to concurrently measure brain activity of two individuals in a human-human-agent team during a complex, ecologically valid collaborative task, with a goal of identifying quantitative markers of cognition- and affect-based trust alongside team processes of coordination, strategy formulation, and affect management. Two multidimensional extensions of recurrence quantification analysis, a nonlinear method based in dynamical systems theory, are presented to quantify interpersonal coupling and team-level regularity as reflected in the hemodynamics of three cortical regions across multiple time-scales. Mixed-effects regressions reveal that neural recurrence between individuals uniquely reflects changes in self-reported trust, while team-level neural regularity inversely predicts self-reported team processes. Additionally, we show that recurrence metrics capture temporal dynamics of affect-based trust consistent with existing theory, showcasing the interpretability and specificity of these metrics for disentangling complex team states and processes. This paper presents a novel, interpretable, and computationally efficient model-free method capable of differentiating between latent trust and team processes a complex, naturalistic task setting. We discuss the potential applications of this technique for continuous monitoring of team states, providing clear targets for the future development of adaptive human-agent teaming systems.},

To do this, we designed a study comparing people's interaction with two very different classes of file system access interface: Focus, explicitly designed for tabletops, and the familiar hierarchical Windows Explorer. In our within-subjects double-crossover study, participants collaborated on 4 planning tasks. Based on video, logs, questionnaires and interviews, we conclude that both classes of interface have a place. Notably, Focus contributed to improved collaboration and more efficient use of the workspace than with Explorer.

By applying an integrative mixed-methods approach drawing on trace ethnography, we place these alleged cases of bot-bot conflict into context and arrive at a better understanding of these interactions. We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia. We have also released our data collection, processing, and analysis pipeline, to facilitate computational reproducibility of our findings and to help other researchers interested in conducting similar mixed-method scholarship in other platforms and contexts.},

abstract = {A practical recommender system should be able to handle heterogeneous behavioral feedback as inputs and has multi-task outputs ability. Although the heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF) and multi-task learning (MTL) methods has been well studied, there is still a lack of targeted manner in their combined fields, i.e., Multi-behavior Multi-task Recommendation (MMR). To fill the gap, we propose a novel recommendation framework called Behavior-aware Variational AutoEncoder (BVAE), which meliorates the parameter sharing and loss minimization method with the VAE structure to address the MMR problem. Specifically, our BVAE includes behavior-aware semi-encoders and decoders, and a target feature fusion network with a global feature filtering network, while using standard deviation to weigh loss. These modules generate the behavior-aware recommended item list via constructing better semantic feature vectors for users, i.e., from dual perspectives of behavioral preference and global interaction. In addition, we optimize our BVAE in terms of adaptability and robustness, i.e., it is concise and flexible to consume any amount of behaviors with different distributions. Extensive empirical studies on two real and widely used datasets confirm the validity of our design and show that our BVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art related baseline methods under multiple evaluation metrics. The processed datasets, source code, and scripts necessary to reproduce the results can be available at https://github.com/WitnessForest/BVAE.},

abstract = {The Industrial Internet accelerates the network integration and collaborative communication of IT and OT, and has become the critical technical support for smart factories. Using OPC UA as the industrial network communication infrastructure can realize the interconnection and intercommunication of heterogeneous network devices, breaking information islands and data barriers. However, with the diversification of industrial data types and the continuous increase of data volume, the single communication mode based on OPC UA has poor performance in real-time data transmission and high network delay. It is difficult to meet high real-time and high reliability requirements. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a deterministic communication model for Industrial Internet based on OPC UA-TSN. Integrate the two communication architectures of OPC UA and TSN, and use OPC UA as the communication specification for heterogeneous network devices to realize the interconnection and intercommunication of the underlying industrial network. We use TSN to replace traditional industrial Ethernet as the network data transmission medium to ensure the deterministic transmission of time-sensitive data. In addition, an OPC UA-TSN message mapping method and an OPC UA-TSN network configuration scheme are constructed to realize the intercommunication between OPC UA and TSN. At the same time, we propose a frame-preemptive dynamic scheduling algorithm for TSN (FPDS), which reasonably allocates bandwidth resources to each priority data stream. The experimental results show that this model realizes the network communication between OPC UA and TSN. It can schedule different types of data streams, effectively reducing the transmission delay of time-sensitive data. This model ensures the efficient utilization of TSN queues and improves the quality of service level of the smart factory communication network.},

By using the Google ARCore position tracking, we can integrate the keyframes captured with one external depth sensor attached to the mobile phone as one single 3D point-cloud data set to present the local physical environment into the VR world. This captured local scene is then wirelessly streamed to the remote side for the expert to view while wearing a mobile VR headset (HTC VIVE Focus). In this case, the remote expert can immerse himself/herself in the VR scene and provide guidance just as sharing the same work environment with the local worker. In addition, the remote guidance is also streamed back to the local side as an AR cue overlaid on top of the local video see-through display. Our proposed mobile remote collaboration system supports a pair of participants performing as one remote expert guiding one local worker on some physical tasks in a more natural and efficient way in a large scale work space from a distance by simulating the face-to-face co-work experience using the Mixed-Reality technique.},

We decompose the function into more primitive commands that are executed autonomously by individual users. These commands require a mechanism to dynamically replicate user-interface and program components on a user's site. We present a logging approach for implementing the mechanism that records input (output) messages sent to one incarnation of a program (user-interface) component, and replays the recorded messages to a different incarnation of the component. Preliminary experiments with an implementation of the mechanism show that response and completion times can improve by dynamically changing the architecture to adapt to changes to the set of users in a collaboration session involving a mix of mobile and stationary devices.},

abstract = {Mixed reality (MR) technologies and applications, including interpersonal communication, are rapidly evolving. Despite its promise, peoples' actual needs concerning the advanced uses of MR are less studied. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted two focus group user studies in which we explored people's perceptions, expectations, and ideas concerning remote interpersonal MR communication and collaboration. In the first study we examined people's perceptions of MR and the study participants collaboratively created 21 scenarios for MR communication. For the second study, the most promising of these scenarios were selected and refined to develop three different types of scenarios one with emotional content, one emphasizing entertainment and one focused on work-related situations. The scenarios were evaluated by the participants of the second study in the context of a specific MR communication system that uses near-eye displays. The results indicate that the expected advantages of MR in communication are its efficiency, richness and the increased feeling of presence over distance. However, concerns were raised about the technical reliability, usability and accessibility of advanced MR applications. Work and entertainment use contexts were preferred over emotional communication. Maintaining close emotional relationships was perceived to require real physical presence and interaction instead of being technology-mediated.},

abstract = {Recent advances in cross-technology communication have significantly improved the spectrum efficiency in the same Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band among heterogeneous wireless devices (e.g., WiFi and ZigBee). However, further performance improvement in the whole network is hampered because the cross-technology network layer is missing. As the first cross-technology network layer design, our work, named ECT, opens a promising direction for significantly reducing the packet delivery delay via collaborative and concurrent cross-technology communication between WiFi and ZigBee devices. Specifically, ECT can dynamically change the nodes’ priorities and reduce the delivery delay from high-priority nodes under unreliable links. The key idea of ECT is to leverage the concurrent transmission of important data and raw data from ZigBee nodes to the WiFi access point. We extensively evaluate ECT under different network settings, and results show that our ECT’s packet delivery delay is more than 29 times lower than the current state-of-the-art solution.},

abstract = {We present Group Touch, a method for distinguishing among multiple users simultaneously interacting with a tabletop computer using only the touch information supplied by the device. Rather than tracking individual users for the duration of an activity, Group Touch distinguishes users from each other by modeling whether an interaction with the tabletop corresponds to either: (1) a new user, or (2) a change in users currently interacting with the tabletop. This reframing of the challenge as distinguishing users rather than tracking and identifying them allows Group Touch to support multi-user collaboration in real-world settings without custom instrumentation. Specifically, Group Touch examines pairs of touches and uses the difference in orientation, distance, and time between two touches to determine whether the same person performed both touches in the pair. Validated with field data from high-school students in a classroom setting, Group Touch distinguishes among users "in the wild" with a mean accuracy of 92.92% (SD=3.94%). Group Touch can imbue collaborative touch applications in real-world settings with the ability to distinguish among multiple users.},

The goal of the workshop is to foster discussion and collaboration among researchers from cloud/edge/fog computing and performance analysis communities, to share the relevant topics and results of the current approaches proposed by industry and academia. FastContinuum solicited full papers as well as demo and short papers including reports about research activities not mature enough for a full paper as well as new ideas and vision papers.The final program includes four full papers and three short ones. They cover some of the most interesting areas of computing continua, from FaaS development and acceleration to the management of heterogeneous datasets to the development of Infrastructure as Code and the automation of deployment through the computing continuum. DevSecOps is also brought to the attendees' attention as one of the crucial ingredients for proper management of the continuum.The workshop keynote, given by Samuel Kunev, investigates further the area of serverless computing properly positioning the multiple aspects and approaches developed in this area and highlighting the main challenges related to the performance of these approaches. The keynote is held in collaboration with the eleventh International Workshop on Load Testing and Benchmarking of Software Systems (LTB 2023).},

abstract = {We consider in this paper a popular class of recommender systems that are based on Collaborative Filtering (CF for short). CF is the process of predicting customer ratings to items based on previous ratings of (similar) users to (similar) items, and is typically used by a single organization, using its own customer ratings.We argue here that a multi-organization collaboration, even for organizations operating in different subject domains, can greatly improve the quality of the recommendations that the individual organizations provide to their users. To substantiate this claim, we present C2F (Collaborative CF), a recommender system that retains the simplicity and efficiency of classical CF, while allowing distinct organizations to collaborate and boost their recommendations. C2F employs CF in a distributed fashion that improves the quality of the generated recommendations, while minimizing the amount of data exchanged between the collaborating parties. Key ingredient of the solution are succinct signatures that can be computed locally for items (users) in a given organization and suffice for identifying similar items (users) in the collaborating organizations. We show that the use of such compact signatures not only reduces data exchange but also allows to speed up, by over 50%, the recommendations computation time.},

abstract = {The improvement of Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery techniques are national priorities in the wake of man-made and nature inflicted calamities of the last decade. Our prior work has demonstrated that the efficiency of sharing and managing information plays an important role in business recovery efforts after disaster event. With the proliferation of smart phones and wireless tablets, professionals who have an operational responsibility in disaster situations are relying on such devices to maintain communication. Further, with the rise of social media, technology savvy consumers are also using these devices extensively for situational updates. In this paper, we address several critical tasks which can facilitate information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for major disaster recovery planning and management. We design and implement an All-Hazard Disaster Situation Browser (ADSB) system that runs on Apple's mobile operating system (iOS) and iPhone and iPad mobile devices. Our proposed techniques create a collaborative solution on a mobile platform using advanced data mining and information retrieval techniques for disaster preparedness and recovery that helps impacted communities better understand the current disaster situation and how the community is recovering. Specifically, hierarchical summarization techniques are used to generate brief reviews from a large collection of reports at different granularities; probabilistic models are proposed to dynamically generate query forms based on user's feedback; and recommendation techniques are adapted to help users identify potential contacts for report sharing and community organization. Furthermore, the developed techniques are designed to be all-hazard capable so that they can be used in earthquake, terrorism, or other unanticipated disaster situations.},

Eliciting and defining requirements for a software system in a distributed environment with heterogeneous stakeholders is generally challenging. In EU projects partners can have different objectives and views, needs are not sharply defined and communication is hampered both by differences in native spoken languages and by the physical distance of the stakeholders. This paper presents the definition and the results of applying an innovative requirements elicitation and refinement approach in the context of an EU financed project (Learn PAd). The approach combines the KJ-method and collaborative wiki-based requirement sessions to come to a set of consolidated requirements. The paper includes the lessons learnt from this experience, also it discusses both the advantages, and the drawbacks of the instantiated approach.},

abstract = {Based on a naturalistic study of industrial designers engaged in collocated collaborative design work in a technologically unsophisticated environment, we observed a number of interactions that lead to a number of insights, namely, (1) seating and the shape and orientation of the working surface has an effect on line of sight and eye-contact behaviors, (2) being able to reach objects on the working surface effects an individual collaborator's ability to become the focus of attention, (3) in collaborative work, people may work on the same document or divide labors to work on different documents simultaneously, (4) supporting the use of conventional artifacts that users are familiar with is as important as supporting the use of informational devices, (5) large workspaces with different privacy levels support both the needs of sharing information and the needs of keeping information private, (6) changes of document orientation socially represents a corresponding change of control and privacy level. From these insights and from other sources in the literature, we describe and illustrate a number of concepts for integrated technologies and environments that can support collocated collaborative work specifically in the context of design work. These concepts are intended as an exercise in divergent design thinking that owes to carefully constructed insights based on observations.},

These technologies are often disconnected and require separate maintenance and coordination. This system leads to more complex processing and communication that creates confusion in collaboration. It is also time consuming, have little or no flexibility and accumulates data overhead. To address these issues, we propose a new Integrated Internet and Intranet (I3) architecture, information flow models and optimization techniques to streamline the communication and enhance the collaboration. With an efficient Big Data processing design and optimization techniques, we reduce the complexity and enhance the computer-human interaction. Our implementation of this architecture in a non-profit international organization showed significant improvement in communication and collaboration by reducing the number of emails, duplicates of documents, man-hours, and number of steps for each task.},

Enterprise software is often developed by a systems integrator that makes modifications to a pre-made package or builds tailored software for the specific purpose. The development may include many developer organizations, the user organization, and their different departments and sub-units. Their collaboration evolves through project incidents, phases and even crises. The practices of project management, communication, contracts, and ultimately personal relationships change intentionally or unintentionally. These changes may cause uncertainties and discontinuities for the development. This study observes changes during enterprise software development and their influence on collaboration practices in different situations. During twenty years of development both internal and external crises and changes in the business environment triggered changes in collaboration. The collaboration practices are classified with four modes of collaboration (contract, cooperation, personified, and process) that illustrate emphasis in collaboration in different circumstances.},

Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing. Finally we will treat briefly the start of international networking in India around 1990, and the bringing the academics of Central Asia and the Caucasus into the Internet community.},

We explore factors that affect the behavior of the user with the out-of-body vision using a prototype of our proposed system LiDARMAN.

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising technique for edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping training data locally on the device, thereby removing the need to store and access the full data in the cloud. However, FL is difficult to implement, test and deploy in practice considering heterogeneity in common edge device settings, making it fundamentally hard for researchers to efficiently prototype and test their optimization algorithms. In this work, our aim is to alleviate this problem by introducing FL_PyTorch : a suite of open-source software written in python that builds on top of one the most popular research Deep Learning (DL) framework PyTorch. We built FL_PyTorch as a research simulator for FL to enable fast development, prototyping and experimenting with new and existing FL optimization algorithms. Our system supports abstractions that provide researchers with a sufficient level of flexibility to experiment with existing and novel approaches to advance the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, FL_PyTorch is a simple to use console system, allows to run several clients simultaneously using local CPUs or GPU(s), and even remote compute devices without the need for any distributed implementation provided by the user. FL_PyTorch also offers a Graphical User Interface. For new methods, researchers only provide the centralized implementation of their algorithm. To showcase the possibilities and usefulness of our system, we experiment with several well-known state-of-the-art FL algorithms and a few of the most common FL datasets.},

By building an reverse geocoding system based on kd-tree for vehicle onboard devices, as well by combining travel restriction information with the current location, a spatiotemporal collaborative algorithm is applied to determine whether a motor vehicle is restricted at that time. Then a voice broadcast is provided. The effectiveness of the system was verified through the design of three different testing scenarios.},

We propose a novel collaborative monitoring frame-work to track circuit level performance degradation caused specifically by NBTI. We use heterogeneous on-chip sensors to measure environmental and stress parameters and a macro-model to map the device-level degradation information into circuit-level reliability estimates. The macro-model is built using curve-fitted data and provides a practical upper bound of the path-delay-degradation to expect under a given set of dynamic parameters which includes operating conditions, process and stress parameters. Through usage of on-chip sensing resources we minimize the need for extensive circuit-specific analyses and also, the pessimism caused by assuming worst-case operating corners. We validate our approach on ISCAS-85 benchmarks and observe excellent correlation (&gt;0.99) between worst-case SPICE observed and model-predicted path-delay degradation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new Wiki called SAVVY Wiki that realizes context-oriented, collective and collaborative knowledge management environments that are able to reflect users' intentions and recognitions. Users can collaboratively organize fragmentary knowledge with the help of the SAVVY Wiki. Fragmentary knowledge, in this case, implies existing Wiki content, multimedia content on the web, and so on. Users select and allocate fragmentary knowledge in different contexts onto the SAVVY Wiki. Owing to this operation, it is ensured that related pages belong to the same contexts. That is, users can find correlations among the pages in a Wiki. The SAVVY Wiki provides new collective knowledge created from fragmentary knowledge, depending on contexts, in accordance with the users' collaborative operations. Various collaborative working environments have been developed for the sharing of collective knowledge. Most current Wikis have a collaborative editing mode to every page, as a platform to enable a collaborative working environment. In order to understand an arbitrary concept thoroughly, it is necessary to find correlations among the various threads of content, depending on the users' purpose, task or interest. In a Wiki system, it is important to realize a collaborative editing environment with correlation among pages depending on the contexts. In this paper, we present a method to realize the SAVVY Wiki, and describe its developing prototype system.},

abstract = {Recently, federated recommendation has become a research hotspot mainly because of users’ awareness of privacy in data. As a recent and important recommendation problem, in heterogeneous one-class collaborative filtering (HOCCF), each user may involve of two different types of implicit feedback, that is, examinations and purchases. So far, privacy-preserving HOCCF has received relatively little attention. Existing federated recommendation works often overlook the fact that some privacy sensitive behaviors such as purchases should be collected to ensure the basic business imperatives in e-commerce for example. Hence, the user privacy constraints can and should be relaxed while deploying a recommendation system in real scenarios. In this article, we study the federated multi-behavior recommendation problem under the assumption that purchase behaviors can be collected. Moreover, there are two additional challenges that need to be addressed when deploying federated recommendation. One is the low storage capacity for users’ devices to store all the item vectors, and the other is the low computational power for users to participate in federated learning. To release the potential of privacy-preserving HOCCF, we propose a novel framework, named discrete federated multi-behavior recommendation (DFMR), which allows the collection of the business necessary behaviors (i.e., purchases) by the server. As to reduce the storage overhead, we use discrete hashing techniques, which can compress the parameters down to 1.56% of the real-valued parameters. To further improve the computation-efficiency, we design a memorization strategy in the cache updating module to accelerate the training process. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show the superiority of our DFMR in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

Therefore, peers have to manage the risks involved in the collaboration when prior experience and knowledge about each other are imcomplete. The behaviors of a party are undertain and attributes of a party, requested objects, and context information are mutable. To address above changllenges, we integrate Dirichlet reputation into usage control to manage authentication and authorization in a collaborative enviornment. We added moving window mechanism to the Dirichlet reputation evaluation. Moving windows not only help to adjust our responsiveness of our system to changes in peers' behaviors, but also allow us to use different strategies to react to different group of peers. Our system offers a way to handle uncertainty and mutability by dynamically revoke granted privileges from a party due to low reputation or changed attributes and context information.},

abstract = {Today, often small, heterogeneous systems have to cooperate in order to fulfill a certain task. Interoperability between these systems is needed for their collaboration. However, achieving this interoperability raises several problems. For example, embedded systems might induce a higher probability for a system failure due to constrained power supply. Nevertheless, interoperability must be guaranteed even in scenarios where embedded systems are used. To overcome this problem, we use services to abstract the functionality from the system which realizes it. We outline how services can be generated using software product line techniques to bridge the heterogeneity of cooperating systems. Additionally, we address runtime changes of already deployed services to overcome system failures. In this paper, we show the runtime adaption process of these changes which includes the following two points. First, we outline why feature-oriented programming is appropriate in such scenarios. Second, we describe the runtime adaption process of services with feature-oriented programming.},

abstract = {In collaborative learning environments, effective intelligent learning systems need to accurately analyze and understand the collaborative discourse between learners (i.e., group modeling) to provide adaptive support. We investigate how automatic speech recognition&nbsp;(ASR) errors influence discourse models of small group collaboration in noisy real-world classrooms. Our dataset consisted of 30 students recorded by consumer off-the-shelf microphones&nbsp;(Yeti Blue) while engaging in dyadic- and triadic- collaborative learning in a multi-day STEM curriculum unit. We found that two state-of-the-art ASR systems (Google Speech and OpenAI Whisper) yielded very high word error rates (0.822, 0.847) but very different profiles of error with Google being more conservative, rejecting 38% of utterances instead of 12% for Whisper. Next, we examined how these ASR errors influenced down-stream small group modeling based on pre-trained large language models for three tasks: Abstract Meaning Representation parsing&nbsp;(AMRParsing), on-task/off-task detection&nbsp;(OnTask), and Accountable Productive Talk prediction&nbsp;(TalkMove). As expected, models trained on clean human transcripts yielded degraded performance on all three tasks, measured by the transfer ratio&nbsp;(TR). However, the TR of the specific sentence-level AMRParsing &nbsp;task&nbsp;(.39 - .62) was much lower than that of the abstract discourse-level OnTask &nbsp;(.63- .94) and TalkMove &nbsp; tasks&nbsp;(.64-.72). Furthermore, different training strategies that incorporated ASR transcripts alone or as augmentations of human transcripts increased accuracy for the discourse-level tasks&nbsp;(OnTask &nbsp;and TalkMove) but not AMRParsing. Simulation experiments suggested that the models were tolerant of missing utterances in the dialog context, and that jointly improving ASR accuracy on important word classes&nbsp;(e.g., verbs and nouns) can improve performance across all tasks. Overall, our results provide insights into how different types of NLP-based tasks might be tolerant of ASR errors under extremely noisy conditions and provide suggestions for how to improve accuracy in small group modeling settings for a more equitable, engaging, and adaptive collaborative learning environment.},

This interface employs Microsoft's HoloLens 2 to allow users to draw paths for drone navigation in 3D using hand gestures. Users can place waypoints with a simple pinch gesture, and similarly, delete and move existing waypoints. To validate paths, we leverage the HoloLens spatial map to check for potential collisions ahead of time, greatly reducing the likelihood of a collision during drone navigation. Paths are simplified and cleaned up using density-based clustering to prevent complex or redundant drone movement. In this Late-Breaking Report, we present the design and implementation of our system that integrates mixed reality, natural hand gestures, and drone path planning, which we plan to evaluate in a user study in the near future.},

abstract = {Collaborative bandit learning, i.e., bandit algorithms that utilize collaborative filtering techniques to improve sample efficiency in online interactive recommendation, has attracted much research attention as it enjoys the best of both worlds. However, all existing collaborative bandit learning solutions impose a stationary assumption about the environment, i.e., both user preferences and the dependency among users are assumed static over time. Unfortunately, this assumption hardly holds in practice due to users' ever-changing interests and dependency relations, which inevitably costs a recommender system sub-optimal performance in practice. In this work, we develop a collaborative dynamic bandit solution to handle a changing environment for recommendation. We explicitly model the underlying changes in both user preferences and their dependency relation as a stochastic process. Individual user's preference is modeled by a mixture of globally shared contextual bandit models with a Dirichlet process prior. Collaboration among users is thus achieved via Bayesian inference over the global bandit models. To balance exploitation and exploration during the interactions, Thompson sampling is used for both model selection and arm selection. Our solution is proved to maintain a standard ~O(√T) Bayesian regret in this challenging environment. Extensive empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets further confirmed the necessity of modeling a changing environment and our algorithm's practical advantages against several state-of-the-art online learning solutions.},

abstract = {Over the years, numerous learning methods have been put forward to model and predict different user behaviors on end devices (e.g., ads click, location change, app launch). While the learn-then-deploy approaches achieve promising results in many scenarios, data heterogeneity and variability throw impediment in the way of deploying pre-learned models to a large cluster of end devices. On the other hand, learning on devices like smartphones suffers from limited data, computing power and energy budget. This paper proposes Colla, a collaborative learning approach for behavior prediction that allows cloud and devices to learn collectively and continuously. Colla finds a middle ground to build tailored model for each device, leveraging local data and computation resources to update the model, while at the same time exploits cloud to aggregate and transfer device-learned knowledge across the network to solve the cold-start problem and prevent over-fitting. We fully implemented Colla with a multi-feature RNN model on both smartphones and in cloud, and applied it to predict user locations. Evaluation results based on large-scale real data show that compared with training using centralized data, Colla improves prediction accuracy by 21%. Our experiments also validate the efficiency of Colla, showing that one overnight training on a commodity smartphone can process one-year data from a typical smartphone, at the cost of 2000mWh and few hundreds KB communication overhead.},

Smart environments are often claimed to bring a significant potential towards novel approaches to learning, by increasing students' access to information, enriching the learning environment, allowing students' active learning and collaboration, and enhancing motivation to learn. Nowadays smart environments are being referred to as augmented physical spaces that bring together multiple computational functionalities. These 3D spaces rely on tangibility and full-body interaction with digital content and services through physical environments. The primary goal of these new interactions is to empower collaboration and learning by taking advantage of human abilities to grasp and manipulate physical objects and materials. Using 3D digital models, the final user (students, educators, researchers, and all type of users), can understand the space, ideas and contents more clearly and quickly. Currently, the quick technological development of mobile devices such as Smartphones or Tablets as well as 3D gesture based products (such as Kinect, Wii remote, etc.) allows the visualization, interaction and e-learning strategies without the need to work in specific computer labs with high-tech systems.UXeLATE'12 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the various aspects of educational methods using advanced technologies.The purpose of this workshop is to provide a common forum for researchers, scientists, engineers, architects, and practitioners throughout the world to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in the use of tangible and gesture based interfaces in collaborative experiments, specially focused in e-learning methodologies and multimedia implementations, and its use in the educational framework using mobile technologies.The call for papers attracted 14 submissions and the program committee accepted 6 of them (one as invited paper) and one more paper as Keynote Talk, covering a variety of topics, including the use of social networks in education, educational uses of advanced devices as Smartphones, Tablet or different applications using Augmented Reality technologies, all of them from a Humancentered approaching.We hope that these proceedings will serve as a valuable reference for Multimedia professionals and researchers.},

abstract = {Maker culture emphasizes informal, networked, self- and peer-led learning, motivated by fun and self-fulfillment, and learning through mistakes. However, studies often describe activities involving a lot of guidance. As guidance may lead to both the process and outcomes influenced by those guiding the activity, it is also important to examine how projects evolve without the supporters' push. We take a nexus analytical approach to explore 1) how teens' background, interactions with others, and available materials and spaces are at play when they shape their ideas and outputs in a collaborative maker project with minimal support, and 2) how these factors can be considered to better support learning in such projects. The work carried out by five teens in a local FabLab was based on peer collaboration within changing apprentice mentor pairs. When they ideated and prototyped for a future school, researchers provided minimal support, mainly online. Without their push, teens quickly modified tasks which both guided and narrowed down their thinking. Their experiences from school environment and the FabLab space served as an inspiration as they designed solutions to overcome current problems in the current school setting or digital fabrication process. When making, they gravitated towards processes they had previous experience of or which they enjoyed, perhaps partly affected by the competing discourses of maker culture and expertise we observed to be present in the FabLab space. While building on existing skillsets, this may leave the potential of novel trajectories and expanding one's skills and competences unexplored. Teens' self-esteem improved as they turned from apprentices to mentors for their peers. This allowed them to process their learning from a different perspective. In general, our results paint a detailed picture of the roles of different participants in a maker project and provide an example of how familiar discourses of education persist in teens' designs. Looking at the project through the lens of Nexus analysis contributes to an increased understanding of the space for action and participants' histories, and interactions on the process, valuable for researchers studying DF and making, and practitioners working in makerspaces and FabLabs with different user groups. On a more practical level, our work contributes to a deeper understanding on how to include teens into non-guided and community-driven maker practices. We provide practical implications on how to support learning in collaborative making projects in informal learning situations, and regarding the role of the different actors and the environment in such situations. We also identify avenues for future research in this area.},

abstract = {The Semantic Web is an incomplete dream so far, but a revolutionary platform as Blockchain could be the solution to this, not optimal reality. There is still little understanding of, and support for, the evolutionary aspects of ontologies. This is particularly crucial in distributed and collaborative settings such as the Semantic Web, where ontologies naturally co-evolve with their communities of use. In this setting, different organizations and teams collaboratively build a common ground of the domain. In this "complex" and dynamic setting, a collaborative change process model requires more powerful engineering, argumentation and negotiation methodologies. Blockchain offers a robust framework for teams' collaboration and ontology versioning globally between an infinite number of teams. Blockchain is an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. This makes blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of evolution events, ontology records, and other records management activities, such as ontology evolution, transaction processing and ontology documenting provenance. In this paper, after briefly summarizing the significant features of Blockchain, we describe blockchain-empowered solutions for building an evolution model based on blockchain technology and its artifacts.},

abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) reuses services to automate a business process using a standard interface and message structure. Standards include the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) file for service interface definition and XML Schema Documents (XSD) for message structure definition. Web services uses the standardization where services are invoked using SOAP over HTTP. BPEL is an orchestration language used to describe the execution logic of Web services by defining their control flow. Choreographies are used to capture collaborations between multiple business partners from a global perspective. SOA can generate the result service in XML language. In this paper XML output of SOA is analyzed using the BPEL standardization. Result is sequenced with choreographic rules. Proposed system in this paper suggests the storage of XML data into the database structure with BPEL business logic and choreography. Using BPEL, business process can be integrated into series of discrete services with an end-to-end process flow. This integration reduces process cost and complexity. A choreography model describes multiparty collaboration and focuses on message exchange; each Web service involved in a choreography knows exactly when to execute its operations and with whom to interact. From this intelligent database; result will be easy for retrieval which is the integration of the heterogeneous database integration.},

abstract = {The Watch-and-Comment paradigm has been proposed as the seamless capture of comments made by users when appreciating a video, which is watched using a computer or a TV set, for example. The comments can be associated with the original media in several ways so as to generate interactive videos automatically -- the interactive video corresponding to the original video annotated with the captured comments. In this paper we explore the application of the Watch-and-Comment approach in situations in which the annotations are represented by operators used for the discrimination of instants and time intervals within continuous media. This particular type of annotation can be performed collectively by several users, over distinct instances of media and, for recorded media, at different times. Once these discriminations are available, combinations of the annotations may be employed by several classes of applications such as those which exploit collaborative selection, voting, cutting, classification and evaluation. We show the feasibility of the operators by implementing a proof-of-concept prototype on a Digital Television platform: the prototype supports multiple geographically distributed users who, using distinct input devices, perform collaborative tasks not planned in the original interactive-TV applications.},

abstract = {In our daily lives we are witnessing a proliferation of digital devices including tablets, smartphones, digital cameras or wearable appliances. A major effort has been made to enable these devices to exchange information in intelligent spaces and collaborative settings. However, the arising technical challenges often manifest themselves to end users as limitations, inconsistencies or added complexity. A wide range of existing and emerging devices cannot be used with existing solutions for cross-device information exchange due to restrictions in terms of the supported communication protocols, hardware or media types. We present INFEX, a general and extensible framework for cross-device information exploration and exchange. While existing solutions often support a restricted set of devices and networking protocols, our unifying and extensible INFEX framework enables information exchange and exploration across arbitrary devices and also supports devices that cannot run custom software or do not offer their own I/O modalities. The plug-in based INFEX architecture allows developers to provide custom but consistent user interfaces for information exchange and exploration across a heterogeneous set of devices.},

abstract = {The intensification of competition in the global market and the increase in the demand for personalized customization have put forward higher requirements for the development cycle, production quality and service quality of complex products. By coordinating the data in the two stages of design and operation, this work creates a common method for information integration in different lifecycle stages, which helps to enhance the value of enterprises. Combined with the new generation of information technologies such as industrial Internet, sensor technology and industrial software, a modular design model based on operation feedback is proposed, which helps enterprises to allocate manufacturing resources and design solutions based on market feedback in the design stage, so as to solve the problems of delayed product lifecycle information interaction, low collaboration efficiency, slow response to market changes, etc. A case of a circulating water pump is also analyzed to verify the feasibility of the proposed model in promoting lifecycle information collaboration, and the results show that through the reliability analysis based on operation, the model can reduce the cost by 930,000 yuan on the basis of satisfying the requirements of each sub-system. In summary, the model performs collaborative optimization on the basis of integrating design and operation data, which can promote the improvement of enterprise benefits.},

abstract = {The shortage of females in computer science has been studied before. Computer games have long been one way teenage boys find an interest in Computer Science, but most of those games are not appealing to teenage girls. This paper describes the ongoing collaborative research project which is experimenting with the design of educational computer games. Our research has the objective to influence middle school girls to pursue computer science in high school and college. The games are designed to change the image of computing among middle school girls, and to instill confidence by teaching real computer science concepts through puzzles. Gail Carmichael and her team of graduate students at Carleton University designed and created an educational computer game (Grams House) in 2010 with a "helping others" story. The prototype game focuses on two computer concept puzzles. In summer 2012, two undergraduates Jennifer Latham, and Nathaly Lozano, at Kean University designed and created a companion game (Grams Grocery Shop) with more teen appeal, and two more puzzles. In fall 2012 the Kean University research team piloted the game pair in an after school program at Roselle Park, a local middle school, using attitude surveys and concept quizzes to determine the impact of the games among the students. The pilot games were successful with the middle school students. After they had played the games, many of the girls said they could see themselves studying computer science, even though before the games, very few girls had included computer scientist as one of their two hoped for careers. Statistics gathered during the pilot indicate the need to continue this research, with more students in different demographics, and with more researcher collaboration, in order to design more adaptive games, to determine what specifically about the games influenced the girls the most, and to gain insight into how they were learning the computer concepts in the puzzles.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm that enables collaborative training of machine learning models among multiple participants. However, despite recent progress, existing federated learning systems can still not handle heterogeneous models. For instance, candidate clients with heterogeneous models are inaccessible to the established federated system. And within the federated system, local models are forbidden to be updated to become heterogeneous models, even though the updated models work better.Considering the reality of heterogeneous models, we study two practical scenarios, Local Model Update Scenario and Hetero-Model Enrollment Scenario. We then proposes a novel method to tackle the problems, which we refer to as Federated learning with deep-layer Feature Alignment (FedDFA). FedDFA uses deep-layer knowledge distillation to align the feature representation and solve the knowledge transfer problem of heterogeneous models. We constructed a federated learning system where we take convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as local models and vision transformers (ViT) as heterogeneous models. We trained these models with three datasets (CIFAR-10, CELEBA, and ImageNet-1k) and their non-I.I.D. variants. As a result, our approach facilitates FL with wide applicability for various models and better generalization performance than the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {In order to support co-located collaboration, many researchers are now investigating how to effectively augment tabletops with electronic displays. As far back as 1988, &lt;i&gt;orientation&lt;/i&gt; was recognized as a significant human factor issue that must be addressed by electronic tabletop designers. As with traditional tables, when people stand at different positions around a horizontal display they will be viewing the contents from different angles. One common solution to this problem is to have the software reorient objects so that any given individual can view them 'right way up.' Yet is this the best approach? If not, how do people actually use orientation on tables? To answer these questions, we conducted an observational study of collaborative activity on a traditional table. Our results show that the strategy of reorienting objects to a person's view is overly simplistic: while important, it is an incomplete view of how people exploit their ability to reorient objects. Orientation proves critical in how individuals comprehend information, how collaborators coordinate their actions, and how they mediate communication. The coordinating role of orientation is evident in how people establish personal and group spaces, and how they signal ownership of objects. In terms of communication, orientation is useful in initiating communicative exchanges and in continuing to speak to individuals about particular objects and work patterns as collaboration progresses. The three roles of orientation have significant implications for the design of tabletop software and the assessment of existing tabletop systems.},

abstract = {This paper shares our three years of experience in conducting collaborative-based cybersecurity teaching involving industrial-expertise sharing and an authentic-learning environment. Penetration testing (pen-testing) is widely adopted in the cybersecurity industry. It requires a wide range of skillsets, including non-technical aspects, which are not easy to be acquired in a standard lecture-style setting. While the fundamentals of the skillsets could be taught separately in different modules, an integrated pen-testing module using real-world target applications will provide students with a bird’s-eye view of security assessment in an authentic learning setting. There exist, however, challenges in providing a sustainable structured pen-testing module. These include the evolving industrial best practices and availability of authentic target environments. In this paper, we share our experience as well as best practices in designing and teaching a pen-testing module in our Bachelor of Computing degree program. The module unconventionally adopts a fruitful win-win collaborative paradigm. The students, guided along by professional pen-testers from the industry and academic instructors, pen-test our University’s operational applications selected by the University IT Department. With the completed six semesters to date, our students have tested various applications, including our University’s learning management system, student registration system, and student-hall dining system, which all manage sensitive data. We have received very positive feedback from the parties involved. This paper describes our module’s rationale, involved parties and roles, class arrangements and activities, as well as grading considerations. The paper also discusses encountered issues and our adopted solutions related to University application selection, student contribution assessment, and activity arrangements during the COVID-19 outbreak. Some notes are additionally given for others who are keen to offer similar modules using the same teaching pedagogy. Our experience thus demonstrates that, while provisioning industrial collaboration and authentic learning in education needs to address several technical and administrative issues, a collaborative based teaching paradigm can work well in a sustainable manner.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the main results of the C2M project through one of its operational deliverable: the Scenari4 collaborative editing and publishing system for XML content. The purpose of the C2M project was to design a system able to manage structured and fragmented contents - as XML publishing chains do - while providing collaborative possibilities - as Enterprise Content Management systems (ECM) do. The main issue is related to transclusion relationships which are massively used in XML publishing chains, in order to support repurposing without copying. This approach is not compatible with the classical way ECMs manage content, especially in terms of propagation of modifications, rights or transactions management. We propose two complementary solutions to manage two different levels of collaboration. The workspace is designed as a highly dynamic place able to deal with live fragments, linked together in a network, that can be easily updated at any time by any user. The library is a more static and more classical way to manage content, dedicated to folder-documents, which are XML frozen versions of sub-networks extracted from workspaces. While workspaces are dedicated to content elaboration and maintenance, libraries are places to store, to read, or to exchange stable documents. Scenari4 is released under FLOSS license and has been being used in several experimental and commercial contexts since the beginning of 2012.},

Co-occurrence analysis, mutual information algorithms, LLR algorithms and LSI algorithms, etc. were used to retrieve and summarize the literature collected from 2016 to 2023 using the CNKI database as the data source, to draw the knowledge map and to perform visualization and analysis. The amount of literature on county medical community has increased rapidly from 2018 onwards, and county medical community have become a widely followed field. The collaborative network among authors is relatively loose, and no core group of authors has been formed yet. The research hotspots are mainly divided into three categories, which are the basic theoretical research related to medical communities, the optimal allocation of resources within medical communities, and the analysis of medical community operation models. In terms of cutting-edge trends, information construction, financial management, talent training, medical insurance payment, and medical prevention integration have become new themes and directions for research on county-level medical communities. The field of county-level medical community should further explore cross-sectoral and cross-regional collaborative research mechanisms and strengthen cross-collaboration in different fields. In the future, we should build a big data information system to support existing research, as well as deepen the theory of county-level medical communities by conducting diverse collaborative research models and practical theories combined with research methods.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering has been extensively studied in the context of ratings prediction. However, industrial recommender systems often aim at predicting a few items of immediate interest to the user, typically products that (s)he is likely to buy in the near future. In a collaborative filtering setting, the prediction may be based on the user's purchase history rather than rating information, which may be unreliable or unavailable. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of various collaborative filtering algorithms on a real-world dataset of purchase history from customers in a store of a French home improvement and building supplies chain. These experiments are part of the development of a prototype recommender system for salespeople in the store. We show how different settings for training and applying the models, as well as the introduction of domain knowledge may dramatically influence both the absolute and the relative performances of the different algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, the influence of these parameters on the quality of the predictions of recommender systems has rarely been reported in the literature.},

Although the general sensemaking workflow did not change across the two types of systems, we observed that the system based on the distributed model enabled a more transparent interaction for collaborations, and allowed for greater 'objectification' of information. Our findings have significant implications for how future visual analytics systems can be designed to motivate effective collaborative sensemaking.},

Despite information seeking being an important aspect of collaboration, the information seeking behaviour of older adults and in particular couples remains under investigated. To address this gap, in this paper we present a qualitative investigation of older adults’ collaborative information seeking. Through in-depth interviews and demonstrations of real-life search tasks with eleven older couples, we show that older couples frequently engage in collaborative information seeking in daily tasks, interests, and to satisfy curiosity. Our research suggests that collaborative information seeking is a relationship maintenance behaviour among older couples, and that their long-term relationships may play a key role in how they communicate, make decisions, and develop divide and conquer strategies by taking on various roles during their collaborative information seeking. We also found that older couples construct shared views toward technology adoption and usage despite their individual differences. We include some reflections on the existing collaborative information systems and how they may adapt to fit older couples’ collaborative information seeking.},

abstract = {Academic publication archives often draw from numerous, heterogeneous sources, whose records can follow differing naming conventions. As such, ambiguity issues concerning authorship of scientific papers often arise, such as authors sharing similar names, the use of first names versus initials, or alternate name spellings for the same author. These ambiguities have plagued research on scientific collaboration and influence. Detecting and correcting these errors is important for maintaining the archive, as well as for ensuring correctness and reliability in any desired subsequent analysis. There are existing analytic methods designed to accomplish this with varying degrees of accuracy, but many of them require fine tuning or manual categorization. We have developed a visual analytics system to interactively control and apply several analytic name disambiguation algorithms in a finely controlled manner, and to present the results to the user for verification or correction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system by using it to find and resolve ambiguities in authorship data collected from Cornell University Library's arXiv.org and the InfoVis 2004 contest dataset with improved accuracy and speed over existing approaches.},

abstract = {In this technical demo we present repoVizz (http://repovizz.upf.edu), an integrated online system capable of structural formatting and remote storage, browsing, exchange, annotation, and visualization of synchronous multi-modal, time-aligned data. Motivated by a growing need for data-driven collaborative research, repoVizz aims to resolve commonly encountered difficulties in sharing or browsing large collections of multi-modal data. At its current state, repoVizz is designed to hold time-aligned streams of heterogeneous data: audio, video, motion capture, physiological signals, extracted descriptors, annotations, et cetera. Most popular formats for audio and video are supported, while Broadcast WAVE or CSV formats are adopted for streams other than audio or video (e.g., motion capture or physiological signals). The data itself is structured via customized XML files, allowing the user to (re-) organize multi-modal data in any hierarchical manner, as the XML structure only holds metadata and pointers to data files. Datasets are stored in an online database, allowing the user to interact with the data remotely through a powerful HTML5 visual interface accessible from any standard web browser; this feature can be considered a key aspect of repoVizz since data can be explored, annotated, or visualized from any location or device. Data exchange and upload/download is made easy and secure via a number of data conversion tools and a user/permission management system.},

abstract = {The deployment of a general purpose utility grid can aggregate otherwise disparate and autonomous resources and provide access to grid technology for researchers, faculty and students for learning about grids, testing grid capabilities, deploying applications. Using inter-institutional collaboration to build cooperative, grid computing for all can advance grid technology.Grids for "big science" or specific applications tend to be deployed for long term needs, with significant investment of project specific resources, and perhaps with less concern for integration with enterprise infrastructures. Indeed, such big science grids are "enterprises" in their own right, establishing solutions that sit as a layer of services above, outside and distinct from a researcher's locally affiliated enterprise. There is a need for a utility grid that is differentiated from such application specific grids. Deploying such a utility grid would be a step toward the vision described by Foster et alia in The Physiology of the Grid: An Open Grid Services Architecture for Distributed Systems Integration - serving the "need to integrate services across distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic 'virtual organizations' formed from the disparate resources within a single enterprise and/or from external resource sharing and service provider relationships."Work begun as part of the NSF Middleware Initiative Integration Testbed Program has evolved from deploying individual campus grids to the work of SURAGrid. SURAGrid is engaging a broader collaboration of researchers, educators and students across the southeast and beyond to create a model of cooperative grid computing infrastructure and disseminate exemplars of technology, best practices, policy solutions and grid applications.},

abstract = {Agents frequently collaborate to achieve a shared goal or to accomplish a task that they cannot do alone. However, collaboration is difficult in open multi-agent systems where agents share constrained resources to achieve both individual and shared goals. In current approaches to collaboration, agents are organised into disjoint groups and social reasoning is used to capture their capabilities when selecting a qualified set of collaborators. These approaches are not useful when agents are in multiple, overlapping groups; depend on each other when using shared resources; have multiple goals to achieve simultaneously; and have to share the overall costs and benefits. In this article, agents use social reasoning to enhance their understanding of other agents’ goals and their dependencies, and self-adaptive techniques to adapt their level of self-interest in a collaborative process, with a view to contributing to lowering shared costs or increasing shared benefits. This model aims at improving the extent to which agents’ goals are met while improving shared resource usage efficiency. For example, in a public transport system where each mode of transport has limited capacity, commuters will be enabled to make choices that avoid over-capacity in different modes, or in a smart energy grid with limited capacity, users can make choices as to when they increase their demand. The model simultaneously helps avoid overloading a shared resource while allowing users to achieve their own goals. The proposed model is evaluated in an open multi-agent system with 100 agents operating in multiple overlapping groups and sharing multiple constrained resources. The impact of agents’ varying levels of social dependencies, mobility, and their groups’ density on their individual and shared goal achievement is analysed.},

abstract = {The incorporation of haptic interfaces into collaborative virtual environments is challenging when the users are geographically distributed. Reduction of latency is essential for maintaining realism, causality and the sense of co-presence in collaborative virtual environments during closely-coupled haptic tasks. In this study we consider the effects of varying amounts of simulated constant delay on the performance of a simple collaborative haptic task. The task was performed with haptic feedback alone or with visual feedback alone. Subjects were required to make a coordinated movement of their haptic displays as rapidly as possible, while maintaining a target simulated spring force between their end effector and that of their collaborator. Increasing simulated delay resulted in a decrease in performance, either in deviation from target spring force and in increased time to complete the task. At large latencies, there was evidence of dissociation between the states of the system that was observed by each of the collaborating users. This confirms earlier anecdotal evidence that users can be essentially seeing qualitatively different simulations with typical long distance network delays.},

abstract = {The process of political decision making is often complex and tedious. The policy process consists of multiple steps, most of them are highly iterative. In addition, different stakeholder groups are involved in political decision making and contribute to the process. A series of textual documents accompanies the process. Examples are official documents, discussions, scientific reports, external reviews, newspaper articles, or economic white papers. Experts from the political domain report that this plethora of textual documents often exceeds their ability to keep track of the entire policy process. We present PolicyLine, a visualization system that supports different stakeholder groups in overview-and-detail tasks for large sets of textual documents in the political decision making process. In a longitudinal design study conducted together with domain experts in political decision making, we identified missing analytical functionality on the basis of a problem and domain characterization. In an iterative design phase, we created PolicyLine in close collaboration with the domain experts. Finally, we present the results of three evaluation rounds, and reflect on our collaborative visualization system.},

abstract = {In recent years pervasive mobile and embedded computing has been spurred on by the resurgence of tablet devices, like the iPad, and the rise of powerful mobile and embedded devices, such as smart phones, netbooks, media players, e-book readers, and TV set-top boxes. These devices combine the performance and rich interaction of PCs with the portability and freedom provided by PDAs, and enable a wide spectrum of novel pervasive applications, ranging from healthcare monitoring, to enhanced shopping environments, ad-hoc gaming, and context-aware collaborative computing. Enhanced with access to cloud computing infrastructures, offering unlimited storage and computing resources, they are able to support pervasive applications of increasing sophistication.Despite some successes, the development of applications for this kind of devices remains largely a complex and time-consuming process. Heterogeneous programming interfaces and platform characteristics mean that applications are built in an ad-hoc manner with little possibility for code reuse. As the number and type of devices and pervasive applications increases, so does the need to enable interoperation between them. In this context, middleware platforms can play a key role by facilitating application development, fostering software reuse, and enabling rapid prototyping of pervasive applications. However, the extent to which traditional middleware abstractions and services can be offered on this kind of devices remains largely unexplored. Simply porting existing middleware platforms on these devices is often not feasible.The M-MPAC workshop, building on the success of last year's event, sought to further develop a roadmap for research on the essential middleware abstractions and infrastructures for pervasive mobile and embedded computing. This year seven papers were selected for inclusion in these proceedings. The papers cover a broad range of issues including dealing with location uncertainty, location privacy management, location and proximity-based device authentication, network communication over multiple platforms, vehicle context-awareness, model-based adaptation, and support for anywhere/anytime personal computing.},

abstract = {This paper presents an educational model derived from open source methods for computer programming. The article places this search for an alternative model within a framework of proprietary educational practices that are driven by a need for efficiency and rationalization. As an alternative model, the paper suggests that an open source derived educational process would emphasize collaborative problem based learning, working through drafts, risk taking, mentoring, user testing, releasing early and often, developing in collaboration with users, and rewarding and building from failure.At the same time, the paper notes that such a system would have much in common with existing theories of project-based or activity-based learning and with traditional methods of research and publication in scientific endeavors. However, the paper also argues that such a method is different from the open-course or open-curriculum projects recently publicized by several well-known universities as these practices appear to emphasize derived content rather than an open representation of process, or how the content was developed.Collaborative, problem-based learning provides constructive approaches for building corporate and community partnerships on university campuses. At the same time, the model teaches students about collaborative work practices, working as part of a larger community, and the nature of collaborative knowledge building. As such, the model reconnects knowledge creation to research communities and to communities of users and it complicates the belief that sustainable, useful innovation can occur within proprietary systems.},

abstract = {In the era of smart devices, the reliance of intelligence is the abundance of data. This data is heterogeneous in nature and generated by many small-scale sensory devices. With their task-specific nature, these sensory devices are energy efficient resources with limited computing and storage power. The effective utilization of these devices requires collaborative execution with remote storage and computing power. Internet of Things defines one such cluster formation of these devices which are single-task specific in themselves but achieves higher goals when executed in a collective environment. Data acquisition from these devices is accumulated at scalable resources like cloud where intelligent processes constitute the foundation of smart environments. However, the current implementations of data acquisition for cloud-centric IoT are driven by the APIs of the device manufacturers, resulting in platforms which are less dynamic and configurable for data acquisition. In this paper, we propose our cloud-centric methodology with the focus on configurable data acquisition from IoT. Our methodology decouples communication of data from the strategical usage of the sensory device. Thus, making it more dynamic and applicable for evolutionary smart environments.},

abstract = {The literature reports research efforts allowing the editing of interactive TV multimedia documents by end-users. In this article we propose complementary contributions relative to end-user generated interactive video, video tagging, and collaboration. In earlier work we proposed the watch-and-comment (WaC) paradigm as the seamless capture of an individual's comments so that corresponding annotated interactive videos be automatically generated. As a proof of concept, we implemented a prototype application, the WaCTool, that supports the capture of digital ink and voice comments over individual frames and segments of the video, producing a declarative document that specifies both: different media stream structure and synchronization.In this article, we extend the WaC paradigm in two ways. First, user-video interactions are associated with edit commands and digital ink operations. Second, focusing on collaboration and distribution issues, we employ annotations as simple containers for context information by using them as tags in order to organize, store and distribute information in a P2P-based multimedia capture platform. We highlight the design principles of the watch-and-comment paradigm, and demonstrate related results including the current version of the WaCTool and its architecture. We also illustrate how an interactive video produced by the WaCTool can be rendered in an interactive video environment, the Ginga-NCL player, and include results from a preliminary evaluation.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a visualization technology allowing virtual information to be imposed on physical objects. The contiguity of two-channel representations can enhance understanding of information by reducing extraneous cognitive load resulted by aligning information from different sources. For example, in chemistry, AR can be used to visualize the reaction of catalysts and provides relevant information like molecules and formulas during a lab experiment in real time. AR also makes user interaction with the content more natural compared to traditional computer-based interfaces, e.g., a user can easily share the content with others by pointing a new device to the same target. There has been much research exploring how these AR affordances can support learning of abstract concepts, invisible or unobservable phenomena, and improve interaction. However, the use of AR is less explored in learning computer programming which actually shares similar challenges: the integration of programming logic and the produced outcome is invisible and the interaction between students is usually limited due to the restricted access to computer keyboards and mice. To fill this gap, this study is aimed to explore how AR can support programming problem solving and group collaboration by multimodal analytics including program snapshots and group conversation. I developed a mobile app, Ogmented, which is able to present collaborative programming tasks by AR visualization and meanwhile collect student's conversation during the tasks for multimodal behavior analysis. The result of a pilot study provides an insight into student's reaction on Ogmented and provides a path to further investigation.},

abstract = {Adopting Product Line Engineering (PLE) approaches in the context of software-intensive systems reduces overall development and maintenance costs, reduces time to market and leads to an overall improvement in product quality. The Software and System Product Line (SPL) community has provided a large number of different analysis approaches and tools, which were developed in different contexts, answer different questions, and can contribute to the fulfillment of different analysis goals. The pursuit of these goals requires holistic approaches, i. e. integrated toolchains and classification of analyses, which are documented as a centralized collection of wisdom. Previously, we proposed a classification system for describing existing analyses. Furthermore, this method supports the search for possible combinations, i. e. toolchains which address the complex industrial needs in the context of adopting PLE approaches.In this paper, we present a prototype of a crowd-sourcing platform to collect and share the required information regarding existing analyses and toolchains. While overviews of PLE-aware analyses exist, we propose an interactive visualisation to identify and document the required input data and resulting information for each analysis method. With this platform, we hope to promote the usage of analysis approaches and encourage collaboration between researchers.},

abstract = {In order to support co-located collaboration, many researchers are now investigating how to effectively augment tabletops with electronic displays. As far back as 1988, orientation was recognized as a significant human factor issue that must be addressed by electronic tabletop designers. As with traditional tables, when people stand at different positions around a horizontal display they will be viewing the contents from different angles. One common solution to this problem is to have the software reorient objects so that any given individual can view them 'right way up.' Yet is this the best approach? If not, how do people actually use orientation on tables? To answer these questions, we conducted an observational study of collaborative activity on a traditional table. Our results show that the strategy of reorienting objects to a person's view is overly simplistic: while important, it is an incomplete view of how people exploit their ability to reorient objects. Orientation proves critical in how individuals comprehend information, how collaborators coordinate their actions, and how they mediate communication. The coordinating role of orientation is evident in how people establish personal and group spaces, and how they signal ownership of objects. In terms of communication, orientation is useful in initiating communicative exchanges and in continuing to speak to individuals about particular objects and work patterns as collaboration progresses. The three roles of orientation have significant implications for the design of tabletop software and the assessment of existing tabletop systems.},

abstract = {Neural-enhanced video streaming (e.g., super-resolution) is an ongoing revolution which can provide extremely high-quality video streaming services breaking the restriction of bandwidth. However, such enhancements require intense computation power that is not affordable for a single mobile device, which hinders their real-world deployment. To address the limitation, we propose OASIS, the first system that facilitates multiple users in close proximity to execute intense neural-enhanced video streaming in realtime. To this end, OASIS intelligently distributes computation tasks among multiple mobile devices, selects appropriate video bitrates and super-resolution models, and optimizes video chunk delivery. As a result, the expensive neural-enhanced streaming is done through distributed collaboration, achieving optimal quality of experience (QoE). We implement and evaluate OASIS on commodity smartphones from different vendors, under various network and computation conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of OASIS: it improves the video streaming QoE by 40%-200% and reduces each participant's energy consumption by 60% when the system scales up from a single device to six devices.},

abstract = {In May 2011 the Health Council of Canada released its second report on the state of healthcare renewal in Canada. Although the report identified that significant progress had been made in several areas since the previous report in 2008, the 2011 report still described the need for more work to ensure that our healthcare system will evolve and be sustainable for the years to come. One particular challenge is the need to integrate services over an expanding continuum of providers, services and illnesses. Healthcare delivery is becoming increasingly complex as it shifts from care provided by a single provider or setting and towards a collaborative care supplied by multiple providers across multiple settings. For example, patients with chronic illness frequently move between inpatient and outpatient settings and require collaboration by physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals who act as an integrated network across hospital and community settings. Another highlighted challenge was the need for performance measurement of healthcare delivery by establishing meaningful targets and measurable goals to enable healthcare delivery is driven by good management practices.In light of the above challenges to healthcare delivery it can be argued that the fundamental challenge our healthcare system faces is one of connectivity. Successful healthcare interoperability will be dependent upon our ability to connect people, processes, data, policies and procedures, as well as the need to connect outcomes to system objectives through performance management. Mobile healthcare has the potential to dramatically extend the reach and impact of interoperability and smart interactions on healthcare outcomes. In our previous three workshops on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH), we emphasized that the fundamental challenges facing interoperability are not technical but rather process, people and evaluation issues. It is important that we do not define interoperability as the ends but rather as a means for achieving core health system objectives such as efficient, effective and timely delivery of patient centered healthcare. Subsequently we should not evaluate interoperability efforts solely by our ability to connect disparate computer systems but rather by our abilities to achieve health system objectives.While the use of technology in healthcare is inevitable, the challenge is developing solutions that enable 'meaningful interoperability'. As we move towards digital solutions such as electronic health records to enhance healthcare delivery, our goal should not be to simply automate existing healthcare processes such as group decision making or communication. Rather our goal should be to leverage smart interactions and technologies to enable processes to go beyond how healthcare delivery is currently provided; we also need to develop and implement business analytic solutions to enable timely evaluation of healthcare delivery. Healthcare is a complex, dynamic and exception laden domain. Smart interactions and mobile technologies provide us the tools to support the dynamic nature of healthcare delivery to enable us to support meaningful interoperability. For example, the management of diabetes requires medical registries to track patients over time and to communicate guidelines for ongoing clinical management. In that context, human factors research, cloud computing, clinical pathway monitoring, and the ongoing evaluation and adoption of standards, technology and processes are all relevant.Meaningful interoperability can also enable performance management solutions to ensure we provide timely, efficient patient-centered care delivery. However, the development of technologies to support meaningful interoperability faces significant challenges such as obtaining consistent, timely, quality data in a secure manner in order to facilitate performance-managed driven healthcare delivery. We also caution that an uncoordinated approach to the design and implementation of smart interactions and other information technology will only create barriers to accessibility and integration by burdening healthcare providers with administrative and information overload that falls short of delivering real benefits. To facilitate meaningful interoperability, we need to first understand the underlying complexity of healthcare interoperability by developing models and frameworks that enable us to effectively leverage Mobile Health and other Smart technologies to support healthcare delivery.This workshop was presented and coordinated by a select group of health informatics, software engineering researchers and practitioners from across Canada and built upon the previous three workshops with the theme of going beyond basic healthcare interoperability with mobile healthcare. Our workshop emphasized the need to develop healthcare interoperability solutions using an interdisciplinary perspective. ISIH workshops have been well attended by a mix of health care administrators, practitioners and representatives from standards body's initiatives, as well as academic researchers and industry partners. The workshop focused on developing an agenda for meaningful interoperability and presenting case studies and anecdotes to illustrate the issues and potential solutions as a starting point for brainstorming as well as research initiatives that can generalize a systematic approach to these issues.The following questions were posed: How can business analytics and care flow process modeling be effectively combined to improve health care delivery (i.e. achieve smart interactions)? What are the current interoperability barriers that need to be overcome in order to achieve meaningful interoperability using smart interactions?The workshop opened with short presentations from the panel members who provided background and outlined their basic position. They also recounted actual experiences or academic results related to the questions. The second half was devoted to an interactive discussion in which the presenters debated different aspects of the problem in response to questions from the audience. The closing portion was reserved for general brainstorming guided by the moderators into a discussion of potential next steps and an action plan for collaboration and further exchanges of ideas beyond the end of the workshop.The panel presentations discussed the promises, challenges and risks of Mobile Health and how we can leverage human factors research, cloud computing, clinical pathway monitoring and the ongoing evaluation and adoption of standards, technology and processes to provide smarter interactions between health care providers and health care consumers (the patients).The workshop concluded with a summation of interoperability issues in health care and a chance to form collaborative partnerships with the workshop participants. The overall objective was to create a call for papers for a special journal issue on interoperability and smart interactions in mobile healthcare.},

abstract = {In the past few years, cloud computing has become an integral technology both for the day to day running of corporations, as well as in everyday life as more services are offered which use a backend cloud. At the same time online collaboration tools are becoming more important as both businesses and individuals need to share information and collaborate with other entities. Previous work has presented an architecture for a collaboration online application which allows users in different locations to share videos, images and documents while at the same time video chatting. The application's servers are deployed in a cloud environment which can scale up and down based on demand. Furthermore, the design allows the application to be deployed on multiple clouds which are deployed in different geographic locations. Previous work however did not introduce how the application's up and down scaling is to be achieved. In this paper the autonomic system which manages the self-optimizing function of the cloud is presented. The autonomic system itself is a self-organizing system with a control model based on the leaky-bucket theory often used in network congestion control. A testbed for the collaboration application is used in order to gather performance metrics for the model.},

Firstly, this work describes the results obtained in the study and development of an agile flexible method to offer support construction, implementation and accompaniment activities of free geo-solutions for the web, aiming at a growing community of users and developers who manipulate geographic data. Next, the development of the OpenICGFw (Integration for Collaborative Geospatial Framework for the Web) that seeks, through a single environment to assist in the integration and collaboration among different sources of spatial data in synchrony with the efforts and specifications of OGC and W3C. To do this, the evaluation study for the construction of the framework is presented where it was possible to apply MCDA-C (Multi Criteria Decision Aiding -- Constructivist) in the identification of the fundamental and elementary aspects for the construction of the framework. Details are presented by means of a case study that illustrates data exported from different geospatial information systems requiring the integration of census, environmental, urban and rural information over the internet. During the discussion the results obtained using this framework are presented, providing, through web mapping applications, the implementation of collaborative strategies seeking the integration of bases distributed for the use of spatial data mining techniques.},

These systems aim to accomplish a certain goal though collaborating between a variety of agents with different tasks, which adapt to changes of environment to be of adaptability. To solve the issue of collaboration of agents in an uncertain and highly dynamic environment, our research team had proposed a Goal-Capability-Commitment (GCC) based mediation for multi-agent collaboration, which generates the collaboration planning driven by capability based on global context states in real-time dynamic environment. As a case study for the application of GCC model, this paper adopts GCC to model the RoboCup Rescue Simulation System (RCRSS). As the result of modelling, the GCC domain model is applied to RCRSS where an efficiently quantitative evaluation is provided.},

abstract = {Another concept of Third Eye is the tracing state. Tracing state is a set of event types generated in that state, other event types are filtered out and not reported. The system is always in a specific tracing state. Tracing states correspond to specifications. A program specification describes a set of constraints on events. The event types used in a specification have to be monitored to validate a trace against this specification. All event types contained in a specification and monitored for this specification form a tracing state. Tracing states also control the overhead of tracing on the executing system.The Third Eye framework includes modules for event type definition, event generation and reporting, tracing state definition and management, trace logging, query and browsing interfaces. Modules of event type definition, event reporting facility and tracing state controler are integrated with the software of the system under trace (SUT). The rest of the modules are independent from the SUT and can be deployed on a different execution platform to minimize the influence on system performance. Trace delivery for logging and analysis uses alternative interfaces to accommodate devices with different data storage and connectivity capabilities.We have implemented Third Eye framework prototype currently used by the Third Eye project team in collaboration with product development teams in Nokia's business units. We used Third Eye to test a number of software systems: the memory subsystem of one of Nokia's handsets, Apache Web Server, and WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) client. WAP is an industrial standard for applications and services that operate over wireless communication networks. We validated message sequences in this protocol by adding events in the functions that correspond to the protocol primitives and then checking whether the event sequence corresponds to the protocol message sequence. Events are mapped to Prolog facts and constraints are expressed as Prolog rules. Third Eye can be used for debugging, monitoring, specification validation, and performance measurements. These scenarios use typed events—a concept simple and yet expressive enough to be shared by product designers and developers. The Third Eye has an open architecture allowing easy replacement of third-party tools, including databases, analysis and validation tools. Third Eye is a practical framework for specification-based analysis and adaptive execution tracing of software systems.},

abstract = {The note or the paper manuscript is established as a simple and fast tool for postprocessing presentations and meetings. This workflow is widely accepted because of its feasibility and availability. But analog paper notes are incompatible with ubiquitous acquisition and distribution, this means an interruption with today's media comprehension and a hurdle for later accessibility of content. The analog media of paper has reorganization and search limitations, especially for the later postprocessing of lectures. The combination of annotations on paper from different audiences is an other problem. It's difficult to handle and it's therefore only rarely used. Synergy opportunities are often lost. The development of recent digital tools for collaboration needs to be promoted to take advantage of collaborative sharing of knowledge. Nowadays video recording systems are used in lectures. This allows the later usage and postprocessing of the recorded lectures. By distributing these multimedia data via the internet, users can select the time and location for viewing. This is a key feature of E-Learning media. In this context, audio-visual media need to be afforded special attention for the collaborative learning of students. The web-based application described in this research paper offers an efficient solution for the collaborative production and also later the collaborative usage and supplementation. The value of lecture recordings increase with annotations and a comprehensive repository accrues. The repository can grow within a short time because of its collaborative development character. Therefore, it can deliver more information than a single person could acquire with paper and pencil within the same time. The paper presents a detailed insight into the implementation of the web tool and an analysis of first application scenarios.},

Teleconferencing systems such as the AcessGrid allow users to meet across geographically disparate rooms but as of now there seems no substitute for face to face meetings. This paper gives an overview of some preliminary work that looks towards integrating eye gaze into an immersive Collaborative Virtual Environment and assessing the impact that this would have on interaction between the users of such a system. An experiment was conducted to assess the difference between users abilities to judge what objects an avatar is looking at with only head gaze being viewed and also with eye and head gaze data being displayed. The results from the experiment show that eye gaze is of vital importance to the subjects correctly identifying what a person is looking at in an immersive virtual environment. This is followed by a description of how the eye tracking system has been integrated into an immersive collaborative virtual environment and some preliminary results from the use of such a system.},

abstract = {Coordination mechanisms are needed whenever software entities in a complex system have to act together for the performance of a collaborative task. We focus on a particular form of coordination mechanism, generic protocols, which are interaction patterns without any application domain information. In addition to their re-usability, generic protocols are the most suitable mechanisms to describe interactions in complex, open and heterogeneous systems. However, before they can be used, such coordination mechanisms need to be extended with the actual application domain information. This extension, called protocol configuration, is usually manually performed by designers, thus introducing potential inconsistencies at run time. These inconsistencies are even hard to anticipate and solve. In the past, we developed a static automatic protocol configuration by introducing information related to the functionalities agents achieve in the system. However, in open, heterogeneous and dynamically evolving systems, agents might be involved in the performance of collaborative tasks whose suitable protocols have not been configured into their model. We fix this limitation by developing a dynamic protocol configuration approach, which adds on top the static one a mechanism to delegate the functionalities which lack in an agent's model. In this paper, we present the delegation mechanism.},

Different mixed-initiative approaches use different methods to engage with the design material while supporting the designer's intentions.

In order to limit miscommunication during the design process, heuristics could be applied.In this paper we present a mixed-initiative tool for evolving dungeons with the aid of game design patterns as heuristics. The tool, the Evolutionary Dungeon Designer, uses a genetic algorithm that searches for levels containing game design patterns on two hierarchical levels of abstraction to express more complex gameplay in the game level.We evaluate the tool through a series of lab experiments and a user study conducted with professional game developers. Our results demonstrate that we are able to control the generation of the different patterns with the aid of design pattern-related input parameters, as well as identifying a number of features a design pattern-based mixed-initiative tool could benefit from.},

I then study the impact that different agents have on reliance, performance, cognitive load and trust. I seek to understand which aspects of an agent influence the development of trust the most.

abstract = {In May 2013 the Health Council of Canada released its third report on the state of healthcare renewal in Canada. Although the report identified that significant progress had been made in several areas since the previous reports in 2008 and 2011, this year's report still described the need for work to ensure our healthcare system evolves and will be sustainable for the years to come.One particular challenge is the need to integrate services over an expanding continuum of providers, services and illnesses. Healthcare delivery is becoming increasingly complex as it shifts from care provided by a single provider and setting to collaborative care provided by multiple providers across multiple settings. For example, patients with chronic illness frequently move between inpatient and outpatient settings and require collaboration by physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals that act as an integrated network across hospital and community settings.Another highlighted challenge was the need for performance measurement of healthcare delivery by establishing meaningful targets and measurable goals to enable healthcare delivery to be driven by good management practices.In light of the above challenges to healthcare delivery it can be argued that the fundamental challenge our healthcare system faces is one of connectivity and assurance. Successful healthcare interoperability will be dependent upon our ability to connect and assure people, processes, data, policies and procedures, as well as the need to connect outcomes to system objectives through performance management. Mobile healthcare has the potential to dramatically extend the reach and impact of interoperability and smart interactions on healthcare outcomes.In our previous four workshops on Interoperability and Smart Interactions in Healthcare (ISIH) we emphasized that the fundamental challenges facing interoperability are not technical but rather process, people and evaluation issues. It is important that we do not define interoperability as the ends but rather as a means for assuring core health system objectives such as efficient, effective, and safe delivery of patient centered healthcare.

Our workshop will emphasize the need to develop healthcare approaches to assure safety, interoperability and quality of care at the level of the integrated socio-technical health care ecosystem.The previous four ISIH workshops were well attended by a mix of health care administrators, practitioners, representatives from standards body's initiatives, as well as academic researchers and industry partners.

The second half was devoted to an interactive discussion in which the presenters debated different aspects and issues in response to questions from the audience.

The workshop concluded with a summation of interoperability and assurance issues in health care and a chance to form collaborative partnerships with the workshop participants. In particular, we hope that one of the outcomes of this workshop will be to create a call for papers for a special journal issue on interoperability, assurance and smart interactions in socio-technical healthcare ecosystems.},

abstract = {Proliferating cyber threats, both in terms of diversity and intensity, require a timely development and implementation of effective solutions, which is within the powers of very few organisations, and actually of very few countries. The European Union sees collaboration and the establishment of competence networks as indispensable for securing its digital economy, infrastructures, society, and democracy, and preserving its competitive advantages. Four pilot projects were launched in 2019 within the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme aiming at establishing and operating a pilot for a "Cybersecurity Competence Network" to develop and implement common cybersecurity research and innovation roadmap, to develop and validate an appropriate governance model of the network.The research team of one of the pilots, ECHO, conducted a comprehensive study to identify governance needs, priorities, and models, analysing for that purpose norms, existing networks, and academic sources and interviewing key stakeholders. This paper presents the results of the review of the academic literature conducted to identify and prioritise requirements and support the design of a governance model of a network in the field of cybersecurity. First, it outlines different approaches to creating and governing a Collaborative Networked Organisation (CNO). Then, the authors analyse a variety of CNO governance models and identify possible arrangements for the establishment of collaboration. Further, they examine the collaborative and absorptive capacity of networked organisations and discuss the issues of organisational resilience and value systems alignment in CNOs, with a focus on trust relationships and trustworthiness as one of the crucial factors of success. The paper concludes by summarising the key features of CNO governance models and elaborating on how the identified best practices can be applied in the development of a governance model of a cybersecurity network.},

In order to address these conflicts, we argue that users should be supported by trustworthy agents that adhere to the following criteria: (i) concealment of privacy preferences, such that only necessary information is shared with others; (ii) equity of treatment, such that different kinds of users are supported equally; (iii) collaboration of users, such that a group of users can support each other in agreement and (iv) explainability of actions, such that users know why certain information about them was shared to reach a decision.},

We present VisTorch: a handheld device for projected situated analytics consisting of a pico-projector, a multi-spectrum camera, and a touch surface. VisTorch enables viewing charts situated in physical space by simply pointing the device at a surface to reveal visualizations in that location. We evaluated the approach using both a user study and an expert review. In the former, we asked 20 participants to first organize charts in space and then refer to these charts to answer questions. We observed three spatial and one temporal pattern in participant analyses. In the latter, four experts—a museum designer, a statistical software developer, a theater stage designer, and an environmental educator—utilized VisTorch to derive practical usage scenarios. Results from our study showcase the utility of situated visualizations for memory and recall.},

We identify several features of how the community members artfully integrate their everyday materials, tools, methods and practices into collaborative processes of infrastructuring. The notions of 'artful integrations' and 'infrastructure' sensitize our analysis towards a more conceptual understanding on information system development as multi-relational: socio-material, socio-historical and processual.

abstract = {Studies on collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) have suggested capture and later replay of multimodal interactions (e.g., speech, body language, and scene manipulations), which we refer to as multimodal recordings, as an effective medium for time-distributed collaborators to discuss and review 3D content in an immersive, expressive, and asynchronous way. However, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous VR collaboration (MAVRC) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. This study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing MAVRC as a type of CSCW and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of MAVRC systems. To this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (N = 15) used an experimental MAVRC system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. Qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of MAVRC in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3D scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. We discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for MAVRC systems.},

abstract = {Embedded consumer electronics like video processing systems require large storage capacity and high bandwidth memory access. Also, those systems are built from heterogeneous processing units, designed specifically to perform dedicated tasks in order to maximize the processing efficiency. A single off-chip memory is shared between the processing units to reduce power and save costs. The external memory access is the system bottleneck when decoding high definition video sequences in real time. A four level memory hierarchy was designed to manage the decoded video in macroblock granularity with low latency. The inclusion of the memory hierarchy in the system has also implications on system integration and IP reuse in a collaborative design. This work presents some issues in the integration of the memory hierarchy on the system and practical strategies used to solve them. This architecture was validated and is being progressively prototyped using a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA board.},

abstract = {Real-time collaborative programming environments support multiple programmers to concurrently edit shared source code documents at the same time over communication networks. One of the key challenges in supporting real-time collaborative programming is semantic conflicts, which may occur when multiple programmers are performing concurrent and incompatible programming work in the same source code region or in different source code regions with dependency relationships. Semantic conflicts may result in programming errors that are difficult to detect and costly to resolve. This paper presents in-depth analyses of representative collaborative programming scenarios for understanding the nature and general conditions of semantic conflicts, and proposes a novel Dependency-based Automatic Locking (DAL) approach for supporting semantic conflict prevention in real-time collaborative programming environments. The novelty of the DAL approach lies in its capabilities of supporting automatic and fine-grained locking on selected source code regions with dependency relationships to balance conflict prevention, concurrent work, and programmer convenience in real-time collaborative programming. The DAL approach and technical solutions have been implemented in the CoEclipse prototype system as a proof-of-concept for this emerging technique, which is being continuously extended for further exploration and evaluation.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering approaches exploit information about historical affinities or ratings to predict unknown affinities between sets of "users" and "items" and make recommendations. However a model that also incorporates heterogeneous sources of information that may be available on the users and/or items can become a much more effective recommender, in terms of both increased relevance of the predictions as well as explainability of the results. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that exploits not only such "side-information", but also a different kind of heterogeneity that captures the variations in the mapping from user/item attributes to the affinities of interest. Such predictive heterogeneity is likely to occur in large recommender systems that involve a diverse set of users, and can be mitigated by using multiple localized predictive models rather than a single global one that covers all user-item pairs. The scope or coverage of each local model is determined simultaneously with the model parameters. The proposed approach can incorporate different types of inputs to predict the preferences of diverse users and items. We compare it against well-known alternative approaches and analyze the results in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.},

abstract = {3D point cloud technology facilitates the automated and highly detailed digital acquisition of real-world environments such as assets, sites, cities, and countries; the acquired 3D point clouds represent an essential category of geodata used in a variety of geoinformation applications and systems. In this paper, we present a web-based system for the interactive and collaborative exploration and inspection of arbitrary large 3D point clouds. Our approach is based on standard WebGL on the client side and is able to render 3D point clouds with billions of points. It uses spatial data structures and level-of-detail representations to manage the 3D point cloud data and to deploy out-of-core and web-based rendering concepts. By providing functionality for both, thin-client and thick-client applications, the system scales for client devices that are vastly different in computing capabilities. Different 3D point-based rendering techniques and post-processing effects are provided to enable task-specific and data-specific filtering and highlighting, e.g., based on per-point surface categories or temporal information. A set of interaction techniques allows users to collaboratively work with the data, e.g., by measuring distances and areas, by annotating, or by selecting and extracting data subsets. Additional value is provided by the system's ability to display additional, context-providing geodata alongside 3D point clouds and to integrate task-specific processing and analysis operations. We have evaluated the presented techniques and the prototype system with different data sets from aerial, mobile, and terrestrial acquisition campaigns with up to 120 billion points to show their practicality and feasibility.},

abstract = {Issue Tracking Systems (ITS) often support commenting on software issues, which creates a space for discussions centered around bug fixes and improvements to the software. For Open Source Software (OSS) projects, issue discussions serve as a crucial collaboration mechanism for diverse stakeholders. However, these discussions can become lengthy and entangled, making it hard to find relevant information and make further contributions. In this work, we study the use of summarization to aid users in collaboratively making sense of OSS issue discussion threads. Through an empirical investigation, we reveal a complex picture of how summarization is used by issue users in practice as a strategy to help develop and manage their discussions. Grounded on the different objectives served by the summaries and the outcome of our formative study with OSS stakeholders, we identified a set of guidelines to inform the design of collaborative summarization tools for OSS issue discussions. We then developed SUMMIT, a tool that allows issue users to collectively construct summaries of different types of information discussed, as well as a set of comments representing continuous conversations within the thread. To alleviate the manual effort involved, SUMMIT uses techniques that automatically detect information types and summarize texts to facilitate the generation of these summaries. A lab user study indicates that, as the users of SUMMIT, OSS stakeholders adopted different strategies to acquire information on issue threads. Furthermore, different features of SUMMIT effectively lowered the perceived difficulty of locating information from issue threads and enabled the users to prioritize their effort. Overall, our findings demonstrated the potential of SUMMIT, and the corresponding design guidelines, in supporting users to acquire information from lengthy discussions in ITSs. Our work sheds light on key design considerations and features when exploring crowd-based and machine-learning-enabled instruments for asynchronous collaboration on complex tasks such as OSS development.},

abstract = {I recently argued that Turing, were he alive now, would conjecture differently than he did in 1950, and I suggested a new "Turing challenge" question, "Is it imaginable that a computer (agent) team member could behave, over the long term and in uncertain, dynamic environments, in such a way that people on the team will not notice it is not human". [4]. In the last several decades, the field of multi-agent systems has developed a vast array of techniques for cooperation and collaboration as well as for agents to handle adversarial or strategic situations. Even so, current generation agents are unlikely to meet this new challenge except in very simple situations. The need for agents to work better with people has become greater and more widespread, as evidenced by the Human-Agent Interaction Design and Models Workshop at this conference and an upcoming conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing. Research in these arenas approaches human-computer collaborations from different perspectives, but shares many challenges. Meeting these challenges requires new algorithms and novel plan representations. This talk will explore the implications of this new "Turing question" and examine several challenges that arise in the design both of agents supporting people and of systems in which people assist computers in their work. These challenges include determining a division of labor that respects the complementary strengths of people and computer agents, development of methods for information sharing, defining incentive mechanisms for such settings, and designing empirical methodologies for evaluating agents in open mixed networks [3]. I will describe recent work by my group on interruption management, plan recognition, and test-beds for empirical studies of human-computer collaborations aimed at addressing these challenges, and will discuss our current work on developing intelligent agents able to work as a team supporting health care providers and patients to improve care coordination and in the communication of medical information.},

abstract = {Digital Elevation Modeling (DEM) has been a widely used methodology in plethora of application domains, ranging from climate and geological studies, through temporal evolution of various migration patterns, to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) broadly. However, the existing DEM methodologies and systems cannot quite straightforwardly be extended to catch up with the demands due to recent developments in autonomous driving, vehicle localization, drone and dynamically evolving high-definition smart city modeling. The new challenges are the demand of higher precision, sparse(r) elevation data compression, real-time efficient retrieval and intra-sources data integration. Motivated by this, we take a first step towards developing a tile based, multi-layer high precision DEM system, which aims at seamlessly integrating (and aligning) DEM from different sources, and enables context-driven variations in zoom levels. In addition, to further improve the efficiency of the focused-retrieval of the data necessary to construct the DEM with the desired quality assurance, our vision targets the collaborative compression among heterogeneous data sources.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present "PODIUM (POstech Distributed virtual Music environment)", a distributed virtual environment that allows users to participate in a shared space and play music with other participants in a collaborative manner. In addition to playing virtual instruments, users can communicate and interact in various ways to enhance the collaboration and, thus, the quality of the music played together. Musical messages are generated note by note through interaction with the keyboard, mouse, and other devices, and transmitted through an IP-multicasting network among participants. In addition to such note-level information, additional messages for visualization, and interaction are supported. Real world based visualization has been chosen, against, for instance, abstract music world based visualization, to promote "co-presence" (e.g. recognize and interact with other players), which is deemed important for collaborative music production. In addition to the entertainment purpose, we hope that DVME will find great use in casual practice sessions for even professional performers/orchestras/bands.Since even a slight interruption in the flow of the music or out - of-synch graphics and sound would dramatically decrease utility of the system, we employ various techniques to minimize the network delay. An adapted server-client architecture and UDP' s are used to ensure fast packet deliveries and reduce the data bottleneck problem. Time-critical messages such as MIDI messages are multicasted among clients, and the less time-critical and infrequently updated messages are sent through the server. Predefined animations of avatars are invoked by interpreting the musical messages. Using the latest graphics and sound processing hardware, and by maintaining an appropriate scene complexity, and a frame rate sufficiently higher than the fastest note duration, the time constraint for graphics and sound synchronization can be met. However, we expect the network delay could cause considerable problems when the system is scaled up for many users and processing simultaneous notes (for harmony). To assess the scalability, we carried out a performance analysis of our system model to derive the maximum number of simultaneous participants. For example, according to our data, about 50 participants should be able to play together without significant disruption, each using one track with five simultaneous notes and for playing a musical piece at a speed of 16 ticks per second in a typical PC/LAN environment.In hopes of enhancing the feeling of "co-presence" among participants, a simple sound localization technique is used to compute panning and relative volumes from positions and orientations of participants. This reduced sound localization model is used also in order to minimize the computational cost and the network traffic. Participants can send predefined messages by interacting with the keyboard, mouse, and other input devices. All of the predefined messages are mapped into simple avatar motions, such as playing various types of instruments (players), making applause (audience), and conducting gestures (conductors). We believe that for coordinated music performance, indirect interaction will be the main interaction method, for example, exchanging particular gestures, signals, and voice commands to synchronize music, confirming and reminding expression of the upcoming portion of the music, and just exchanging glances to enjoy each others' emotion. In this view, there would be mainly three groups of participants: conductor, players, and the audience, playing different roles, but creating co-presence together through mutual recognition. We ran a simple experiment comparing the music performance of two groups of participants, one provided with co-presence cues and the other without, and found no performance edge by the group with the co-presence cues. Such a result can serve as one guideline for building music-related VR applications.},

abstract = {The paper proposes an approach to EUD focusing on communities: on the one hand, users are considered as a community of cooperating actors; on the other hand, applications and devices are considered as a (artificial) community that, by interacting with those actors, cooperate to support their collaboration. This idea facilitates an integration based on modularization and abstraction, by applying to the technology principles that are derived from human collaboration: in so doing, it others a uniform approach that allows users with different technical capabilities to operate at different levels of abstraction by applying the same conceptual tools. The community metaphor inspires a model that helps the users community integrating devices and applications according to its needs. In turn, the model defines a layered structure of primitives: from the basic ones up to the domain and application dependent ones, passing through the domain and application independent primitives. The approach is illustrated by an example in the education domain: the interaction flows in an augmented classroom can be defined and adapted by communities where teachers, tutors and students organize their collaboration.},

abstract = {In view of the problems of unclear production status caused by information asymmetry in supply chain manufacturing, this paper uses the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and non-tampering of information of blockchain technology to build a supplier and manufacturing system based on blockchain technology. Manufacturers create an evolutionary game model of information sharing, and analyze the influencing factors of each participant's adoption of information sharing strategies in the blockchain system. The results show that the degree of information sharing, sharing favorable information, collaboration index and incentive index have a positive impact on information sharing strategies, while information sharing risks, information sharing costs, and opportunity benefits have a negative impact. Finally, it provides countermeasures to promote information sharing for supply chain participants to improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain.},

abstract = {Future intelligent system will involve very various types of artificial agents, such as mobile robots, smart home infrastructure or personal devices, which share data and collaborate with each other to execute certain tasks. Designing an efficient human-machine interface, which can support users to express needs to the system, supervise the collaboration progress of different entities and evaluate the result, will be challenging. This paper presents the design and implementation of the human-machine interface of Intelligent Cyber-Physical system (ICPS), which is a multi-entity coordination system of robots and other smart devices in a working environment. ICPS gathers sensory data from entities and then receives users’ command, then optimizes plans to utilize the capability of different entities to serve people. Using multi-model interaction methods, e.g. graphical interfaces, speech interaction, gestures and facial expressions, ICPS is able to receive inputs from users through different entities, keep users aware of the progress and accomplish the task efficiently},

Often, these services in virtual worlds are closely linked with the real enterprise resources. For a successful deployment of these services, a mixed reality model with communications that extend the virtual worlds to enterprise resources is required. In this paper, we take a look at this new class of collaborative applications by using a customer service application as an example. We discuss various issues in offering such a service, lay out the requirements, propose an architecture for mixed reality communications, and present our prototype implementation. We believe that this example service can introduce a mixed reality based communication paradigm that is applicable to a wide range of other business or enterprise services.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how the disciplines of Design and Engineering are jointly addressing disability and somehow affecting its very interpretation. The discussion focuses on high-tech prostheses, where robotic devices substitute human body parts. The application of robotic technologies to prosthetics has a relatively long history. Nevertheless, only in the last decade have we witnessed applications reach the market and become available for a large base of users who were offered prostheses with superior motor and sensory performance. The process of bringing ever more advanced technologies to fruition by prosthetic users is fully ongoing today, with some promising solutions coming from robotics (such as, e.g. AI techniques or soft robotics materials) to be transferred to human use. In this transfer process, technology alone is insufficient to warrant success, and the need for a close collaboration between the Engineering domain and the Design disciplines is apparent. We address this point with specific reference to a case study, i.e. the transformation of an innovative but by-now established technology in the industrial robotics field (the “Pisa/IIT SoftHand”) into a prosthetic hand (the “SoftHand Pro”). Besides obvious technical considerations about size, connections, control, and so on, which can be addressed with a thorough technical revision of the design, what makes the profound difference between the two devices is that, as a prosthesis, the SoftHand is intended as a human body part, and not as an external tool. To reach its ultimate goals, the hand should become a part of the human user, with his body and mind. The empirical approach and tools of Designers afford the possibility to enrich the re-design process, considering the final user at the centre of the process, in a sort of renewed humanistic approach. The paper reflects this multidisciplinary approach and is structured as follows: the first part describes a cultural framework for the use of high-technology upper limb prostheses. This culture is defined through two significant relations (Users &amp; Society; Users &amp; Device). Inputs come from desk research conducted in different fields, ranging from Social Psychology to Medicine and Rehabilitation area. In this scenario, it is possible to extract design insights applicable to the design brief. The introduction of a robotic prosthetic hand (SoftHand Pro) and a related, single-user case study follow. The aim here is also to illustrate a process where engineering innovations are facilitated by tools from the Design field in the attempt to make the whole process coherently centred on users. Involved are all aspects, from material technology to the covering and finishing of the prosthetic device. The resulting, final prototype of the SoftHand Pro is finally presented.},

abstract = {Developing a real-world recommender system, i.e. for use in large-scale online retail, poses a number of different challenges. Interestingly, only a small part of these challenges are of algorithmic nature, such as how to select the most accurate model for a given use case. Instead, most technical problems usually arise from operational constraints, such as: adaptation to novel use cases; cost and complexity of system maintenance; capability of reusing pre-existing signal and integrating heterogeneous data sources.In this paper, we describe the system we developed in order to address those constraints at Zalando, which is one of the most popular online fashion retailers in Europe. In particular, we explain how moving from a collaborative filtering approach to a learning-to-rank model helped us to effectively tackle the challenges mentioned above, while improving at the same time the quality of our recommendations. A fairly detailed description of our software architecture is provided, along with an overview of the algorithmic approach. On the other hand, we present some of the offline and online experiments that we ran in order to validate our models.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm that needs collaboration between a server and a series of clients with decentralized data. To make FL effective in real-world applications, existing work devotes to improving the modeling of decentralized non-IID data. In non-IID settings, there are intra-client inconsistency that comes from the imbalanced data modeling, and inter-client inconsistency among heterogeneous client distributions, which not only hinders sufficient representation of the minority data, but also brings discrepant model deviations. However, previous work overlooks to tackle the above two coupling inconsistencies together. In this work, we propose FedRANE, which consists of two main modules, i.e., local relational augmentation (LRA) and global Nash equilibrium (GNE), to resolve intra-and inter-client inconsistency simultaneously. Specifically, in each client, LRA mines the similarity relations among different data samples and enhances the minority sample representations with their neighbors using attentive message passing. In server, GNE reaches an agreement among inconsistent and discrepant model deviations from clients to server, which encourages the global model to update in the direction of global optimum without breaking down the clients' optimization toward their local optimums. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to show the superiority of FedRANE in enhancing the performance of FL with non-IID data.},

abstract = {With the increasing demand for heterogeneous computing, OpenMP has introduced an offloading feature that allows programmers to offload a task to a device (e.g., a GPU or an FPGA) by adding appropriate directives to the task since version 4.0. Compared to other low-level programming models, such as CUDA and OpenCL, OpenMP significantly reduces the burden on programmers to ensure that tasks are performed correctly on the device. However, OpenMP still has a data-mapping problem, which arises from the separate memory spaces between the host and the device. It is still necessary for programmers to specify data-mapping directives to indicate how data are transferred between the host and the device. When using complex data structures such as linked lists and graphs, it becomes more difficult to compose reliable and efficient data-mapping directives. Moreover, the OpenMP runtime library may incur substantial overhead due to data-mapping management. In this paper, we propose a compiler and runtime collaborative framework, called OpenMP-UM, to address the data-mapping problem. Using the CUDA unified memory mechanism, OpenMP-UM eliminates the need for data-mapping directives and reduces the overhead associated with data-mapping management. The key concept behind OpenMP-UM is to use unified memory as the default memory storage for all host data, including automatic, static, and dynamic data. Experiments have demonstrated that OpenMP-UM not only removed programmers’ burden in writing data-mapping to offload in OpenMP applications but also achieved an average of 7.3x speedup for applications that involve deep copies and an average of 1.02x speedup for regular applications.},

abstract = {In a world of wide-scale information sharing, the decentralized coordination has to consolidate a variety of heterogeneity. Shared data are described in different formats, i.e. data structures, values and schemas. Querying manifold such sources entails techniques that can bridge the data formats. Some of these techniques deal with producing mappings for the schemas of data. The existing techniques view complementary aspects of the schema mapping problem. Important ones, consider producing all the possible mappings for a pair of schemas, insinuating any accompanying semantics in the mappings and adapting correct mappings as schemas evolve. Towards this end we have developed a solution that is fine-tuned for the discovery of mappings as schemas of autonomous sources are gradually revealed. In this demonstration we exhibit a new prototype tool that implements this solution. The tool provides a mechanism that realizes discovery of correct mappings as schemas are revealed. Mapping discovery is schema-centric and incorporates new semantics as they are unveiled. Mapping experience is reused and possible mappings are ranked so that the best choice is presented. The core mechanism collaborates with an automatic schema matching tool and the user that lightly guides the mapping process. The demonstration presents two application scenarios that prove the suitability of this prototype tool and the effectiveness of the implemented mapping solution in realistic situations of of data integration and exchange between heterogeneous autonomous sources.},

There are few studies on how AR systems should be designed to improve cooperation between actors from different organizations while at the same time support individual needs. In the present study an AR system was utilized for supporting joint planning tasks by providing organisation-specific views of a shared working. The study involved a simulated emergency event conducted in close to real settings with representatives from the organisations for which the system is developed. As a baseline, a series of trials without the AR system was carried out. Results show that the users were positive towards the AR system, and would like to use it in real work. They also experience some performance benefits of using the AR system compared to their traditional tools. Finally, the problem of designing for collaborative work as well as the benefits of using an iterative design processes is discussed.},

abstract = {We welcome you to PaIR 09, the 2nd workshop on patent information retrieval, organised by the Information Retrieval Facility (IRF) and Matrixware Information Services. This second edition of our workshop extends and continues topics covered in 2008, but also addresses new interesting subjects.Patent Information Retrieval is an active and challenging field both for researchers and for professional information specialists. Patents play a key role not only in protecting intellectual property but also as a strategic business factor in all modern economies. Despite the enormous advances in Information Retrieval techniques in the past few years, advanced search tools for patent professionals are still in their infancy, so the research in patent retrieval represents an important opportunity for research.Patent search is a particular challenge to information retrieval and access systems. Amongst the challenges successful patent search of search system of the future will have to face are; very large numbers of highly complex structured documents;highly heterogeneous document collections (scientific papers, legal public disclosure as well as patents);multiple languages;ambiguous and conflicting jargon; complex languagetechnological concepts;sophisticated legal jargon;ranges and other complex query formstracking temporal issues like publication datatabular and graphical information mixed into text;and so on.The objective of the workshop is to provide a forum for Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management scientists as well as Patent Retrieval experts from industry to study the next generation of patent search tools.This year the workshop received 13 submissions, of which it accepted 5 full papers. An additional 6 papers were invited to do a short presentation and display posters, in order to trigger interesting discussions on future directions of Patent Information Retrieval.The 5 full papers cover some of the most salient aspects of Patent IR. Phrase-based Document Categorization Revisited (Koster and Beney) addresses the problem of whether or not the use of linguistic techniques improves patent classification. In Identification of Low/High Retrievable Patents using Content-Based Features, Bashir and Rauber analyse the factors that lead to bias in retrieval systems in order to attempt to compensate and make all documents 'retrievable'. Yang and colleagues (A Design Rationale Representation Model using Patent Documents) show us how to model and extract specific information (i.e. design rationales) from patent documents. In a similar line of thought, Tiwana and Horowitz (Extracting Problem Solved Concepts from Patent Documents) work on extracting the essence of a patent: the problem being solved by that specific invention, in order to improve future prior art searches. Further improvements in patent searches may be obtained if one follows the ideas suggested by Klampanos and colleagues in A Case for Probabilistic Logic for Scalable Patent Retrieval.In addition to the 5 full papers, 6 research groups will describe their ideas in a booster session, followed by poster presentations during the workshop's break. The topics covered by these papers tackle patent classification and categorisation, translation, natural language processing and, of course, new ways of performing prior art search.We expect that these papers will trigger interesting conversations and future development in IP search, through a closer collaboration between researchers and industry representatives. We also hope that the workshop will be a springboard for many future events and lead to the recognition of patent searching as one of the central areas of research in Information Retrieval and Knowledge Management.},

abstract = {The increasing interest in supporting multiparty remote collaboration has created both opportunities and challenges for the research community. The research reported here aims to develop tools to support multiparty remote collaborations and to study human behaviors using these tools. In this paper we first introduce an experimental multimedia (video and audio) system with which an expert can collaborate with several novices. We then use this system to study helpers' focus of attention (FOA) during a collaborative circuit assembly task. We investigate the relationship between FOA and language as well as activities using multimodal (audio and video) data, and use learning methods to predict helpers' FOA. We process different modalities separately and fusion the results to make a final decision. We employ a sliding window-based delayed labeling method to automatically predict changes in FOA in real time using only the dialogue among the helper and workers. We apply an adaptive background subtraction method and support vector machine to recognize the worker's activities from the video. To predict the helper's FOA, we make decisions using the information of joint project boundaries and workers' recent activities. The overall prediction accuracies are 79.52% using audio only and 81.79% using audio and video combined.},

abstract = {We present Zoonet, a proactive virtual network telemetry system for multi-tenant clouds. The requirements are to (1) cover hyper-scale virtual networks with millions of tenants and millions of VMs for top tenants; (2) handle frequent virtual topology changes due to tenants' configuration through flexible APIs; (3) adapt to heterogeneous middleboxes along the probing paths; (4) achieve VM-to-VM telemetry without breaking tenant privacy; (5) differentiate virtual and physical network problems. We argue existing physical network telemetry solutions fail to satisfy our needs due to either incomplete telemetry coverage or outrageous telemetry overhead. Zoonet sets an ambitious goal to provide VM-to-VM hop-by-hop telemetry for each tenant, which is achieved based on self-developed, customizable middleboxes via hundreds of person-months under close team collaboration. At the data plane, Zoonet defines an elegant generalization of ping and traceroute, but made to work on multi-tenant clouds with heterogeneous middleboxes. At the control plane, Zoonet conducts substantial probing path pruning and update batch processing to lessen the overhead. Zoonet has been deployed in Alibaba Cloud for over two years, covering tens of cloud regions, hundreds of thousands of servers. We become increasingly reliant on Zoonet as it reduces 86% of the personnel engaged in troubleshooting.},

abstract = {With the number of prescriptions rising nationally each year, it is required that web-based technology will fully embraced in the pharmacy industry as an aid to quality-assuring prescribing processes. Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) has the ability not only to streamline the prescription writing process, but also to reduce the number of errors that may be incurred with hand-written prescriptions. The adoption of ePrescribing nationwide through an ePrescribing system premises active participation of users who are familiar with the cooperative and collaborative nature of healthcare delivery. Thus, there is a need for reusable, flexible, agile and adaptable training content with the objective to enable healthcare professionals instill their knowledge and expertise in the ePrescribing process. To this end, social software, such as a wiki, could be used as it supports cooperation and collaboration anytime, anywhere, combined with semantic web technology that enables structuring pieces of information for easy retrieval, reuse and exchange between different systems and tools. In this paper a semantic wiki is presented as a means for developing training material for healthcare providers regarding ePrescribing process. The semantic wiki should act as a collective online memory containing training material that is accessible to authorized users, thus enhancing the training process with collaboration and cooperation capabilities. It is proposed that the wiki is stored in a secure virtual private cloud that is accessible from anywhere, be it an excessively open environment, while meeting the requirements of redundancy, high performance and autoscaling.},

abstract = {In the current landscape of C++ applications, there is an increasing need of including different levels of support for heterogeneous platforms, where multiple specialised devices collaborate to execute an application. In this context, the SYCL standard[8] has been published by Khronos, providing a C++ abstraction layer on top of OpenCL[9] that enables single-source programming for a large number of heterogeneous devices. SYCL single-source programming and task data-flow approach enable developers to leverage modern programming techniques on heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we present SYCL-BLAS, a BLAS implementation using SYCL that uses Expression Tree templates to generate BLAS kernels. This technique is then used to demonstrate seamless kernel fusion via composition of tree nodes. We also demonstrate how SYCL can be used to quickly develop libraries for heterogeneous systems by providing sufficient levels of abstraction.},

abstract = {On October 26th 2010, a unique HRI-artistic public experiment took place at the UsineC theater, in Montreal. It was the result of a many-months collaboration between the Montreal based lab hosting the [ VOILES | SAILS ] research-creation platform (Self-Assembling Intelligent Ligther-than-air Structures) and the well-known Australian artist Stelarc and his team, who work on artificial agents' embodiment and robotic behaviour modeling.The [ VOILES | SAILS ] project, consisting in the development of flying autonomous robots of geometrical shape, was born from architect and artist Nicolas Reeves' will to evoke the age-old myth of an architecture freed from the law of gravity. These aerobots are meant to be use in artistic installations or performances.An aerobot was combined to Stelarc's artwork named "The Prosthetic Head", which consists in the 5-meters-high projection of a 3D avatar linked to a chatbot-like discussion engine in order to interact with the visitors. Stelarc's artworks development is supported by different universities labs, among which the MARCS Auditory Laboratory in the University of Western Sydney plays a major role. Its team has transposed this artwork into "The Articulated Head", a new version that is embodied via a LCD screen attached at the end of a 6-DoF industrial robotic arm. Thanks to various sensing devices (stereo-camera for people tracking, sound location, proprioception, proximity sensors...), they managed to develop an attention model to control the robot's behaviour. This model, called THAMBS (Thinking Head Attention Model and Behavioral System), adopted a modular approach which allows its adaptation to different sensing abilities and to future robot embodiments.Through intensive international collaboration between Stelarc, the THAMBS and the [ VOILES | SAILS ] teams, we managed to realize a performance during which Stelarc's synthetic head was projected onto a large floating cube, whose movements and displacements in the air conveyed the head's emotions and impressions to the audience. This ambitious collaboration between the two research programs for the creation of a unique new embodiment of "The Prosthetic Head" led to relevant observations that will be the object of a future paper.},

CoFox differs from other collaborative web browsing systems in that it provides a live video stream of web content being viewed by the remote user as the main awareness supporting mechanism. Additionally, it allows users to scroll through the remote user video screen capture to re-watch any part of the search session. As well as screen capture features, also included is a set of collaboration tools including video segment annotations, shared links and instant messaging. CoFox provides a platform for a pair of users to tackle collaborative tasks; which may greatly benefit from the expertise of more than one individual. We outline the graphical user interface components from which CoFox will be composed, the hypothetical benefits provided by such a system and finally describe a possible user-based evaluation methodology.},

abstract = {Fog Computing is a paradigm aiming to decentralize the Cloud by geographically distributing away computation, storage, network resources and related services. It provides several benefits such as reducing the number of bottlenecks, limiting unwanted data movements, etc. However, managing the size, complexity and heterogeneity of Fog systems to be designed, developed, tested, deployed, and maintained, is challenging and can quickly become costly. According to best practices in software engineering, verification tasks could be performed on system design prior to its actual implementation and deployment. Thus, we propose a generic model-based approach for verifying Fog systems at design time. Named VeriFog, this approach is notably based on a customizable Fog Modeling Language (FML). We experimented with our approach in practice by modeling three use cases, from three different application domains, and by considering three main types of non-functional properties to be verified. In direct collaboration with our industrial partner Smile, the approach and underlying language presented in this paper are necessary steps towards a more global model-based support for the complete life cycle of Fog systems.},

abstract = {Low-Code Development Platforms have emerged as the next-generation, cloud-enabled collaborative platforms. These platforms adopt the principles of Model-Driven Engineering, where models are used as first-class citizens to build complex systems, and model transformations are employed to keep a consistent view between the different aspects of them. Due to the online nature of low-code platforms, users expect them to be responsive, to complete complex operations in a short time. To support such complex collaboration scenarios, the next-generation of low-code platforms must (i) offer a multi-tenant environment to manage the collaborative work of engineers, (ii) provide a model processing paradigm scaling up to hundreds of millions of elements, and (iii) provide engineers a set of selection criteria to choose the right model transformation engine in multi-tenant execution environments. In this paper, we outline three research lines to improve the performance of reactive model transformations on low-code platforms, by motivating our research with a case study from a systems engineering domain.},

abstract = {Advanced information systems increasingly use diverse domain-specific resources like services, data, knowledge, etc. One of the today's ubiquitous computing challenges is to automate the mobilization of heterogeneous distributed resources and to allocate them to user-tasks. In this paper, we propose a semantic agent system to solve the problem of resources mobilization and allocation taking into account the continuous changes of the resources conditions. We first propose a formal model of an efficient Resources Mobilization Semantic Agent. Our proposed model is mainly based on ontological models representing basic entities of a collaborative environment as well as their interrelations, rules, inference engine, and object oriented components for resources data processing. Then we suggest mechanisms to handle the discovered resources in terms of updating, filtering, ranking, and allocating. We also provide an application example from the eHealth domain to demonstrate how the proposed semantic agent system can efficiently support the mobilization and allocation of different types of resources according to the user-tasks specifications and to the discovered resources conditions in terms of availability, accessibility, and capability.},

In this paper we present a detailed account of the design process of an indoor wayfinding support tool for firefighters, in which ambiguity played a central role in driving the construction of the system. Based on an ongoing work covering more than a year of close collaboration with a heterogeneous team of project partners, we present some implications of using ambiguity for designing ubiquitous computing solutions in a domain that traditionally requires more formal specifications for the construction of technology.},

However, the design of reliable, intuitive and comfortable user interfaces is a challenging task. In this paper, we focus on one important aspect of such interfaces, i.e., teleoperation. We explain how to setup a heterogeneous, extendible and immersive system for controlling a distant robotic system via the network. Therefore, we exploit current technologies from the area of virtual reality (VR) and the Unity3D game engine in order to provide natural user interfaces for teleoperation. Regarding robot control, we use the well-known robot operating system (ROS) and apply its freely available modular components. The contribution of this work lies in the implementation of a flexible immersive grasping control system using a network layer (ROSbridge) between Unity3D and ROS for arbitary robotic hardware.},

abstract = {As we engaged in designing digital interventions for intercultural dialogues around public cultural heritage sites, we saw an opportunity to surface multiple interpretations and points of view of history and shine a critical lens on current societal issues. To do so, we present the results of a collaborative auto-ethnography of alternative tours accompanied by intercultural guides, to explore sensory and embodied engagements with cultural heritage sites in a southern European capital. By focusing on the differences in how we experienced the heritage sites, we analyse the duality of discomfort, a common concept in HCI, in that it can both be deployed as a resource for designing systems that can transform people’s understanding of history or it can be a hindrance for engagement, having an unequal effect on individuals.},

With the huge potential to benefit users in multiple scenarios (e.g., gaming, education, design, and healthcare), Spatial Computing is growing at an incredible rate, with different attempts to define and capitalize on the growth in both industry and academia. Beyond the location, shape, and relationship of geographic objects, Spatial Computing delves into the social, emotional, and cognitive dimensions of shared spaces. However, the human-computer interaction research on Spatial Computing faces a notable gap, particularly in user experience areas like collaboration, trust, ethics, and accessibility. Addressing this gap, this Special Interest Group (SIG) seeks to unite experts from academia and industry to explore current and future trends in Spatial Computing.},

The great variety of potential benefits of aggregating and connecting embedded systems over the Internet is matched by the currently unsolved problem of how to design, test, maintain, and evolve such heterogeneous, collaborative systems. Recently, component-oriented software development has shown great potential for cutting production costs and improving the maintainability of systems. We discuss component-oriented engineering of embedded control software in the light of emerging requirements of distributed, net-centric systems. Our approach is baed on applying the graphical specification language SDL for composing complex networks of embedded software components. From the SDL specification, we generate internet-aware connector components to local embedded controller networks. The described research is carried out in a collaborative effort between industry and academia.},

Containing millions records of edits across the globe, collaborative systems such as Wikipedia have allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of editors participation and their activity patterns. However, contributions made to Geo-wikis ---wiki-based collaborative mapping projects---differ from systems such as Wikipedia in a fundamental way due to spatial dimension of the content that limits the contributors to a set of those who posses local knowledge about a specific area and therefore cross-platform studies and comparisons are required to build a comprehensive image of online open collaboration phenomena. In this work, we study the temporal behavioural pattern of OpenStreetMap editors, a successful example of geo-wiki, for two European capital cities. We categorise different type of temporal patterns and report on the historical trend within a period of 7 years of the project age. We also draw a comparison with the previously observed editing activity patterns of Wikipedia.},

abstract = {We present a framework to count the number of people in an environment where multiple cameras with different angles of view are available. We consider the visual cues captured by each camera as a knowledge source, and carry out cross-camera knowledge transfer to alleviate the difficulties of people counting, such as partial occlusions, low-quality images, clutter backgrounds, and so on. Specifically, this work distinguishes itself with the following contributions. First, we overcome the variations of multiple heterogeneous cameras with different perspective settings by matching the same groups of pedestrians taken by these cameras, and present an algorithm for accomplishing cross-camera correspondence. Second, the proposed counting model is composed of a pair of collaborative regressors. While one regressor measures people counts by the features extracted from intra-camera visual evidences, the other recovers the yielded residual by taking the conflicts among inter-camera predictions into account. The two regressors are elegantly coupled, and jointly lead to an accurate counting system. Additionally, we provide a set of manually annotated pedestrian labels on the PETS 2010 videos for performance evaluation. Our approach is comprehensively tested in various settings and compared with competitive baselines. The significant improvement in performance manifests the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed in an isolated way that makes it challenging to integrate with each other. One of the ways to integrate systems that provide interoperability is the System-of-system concept. Communication among systems depends on mutual agreements made by intermediaries. It increases the cost, constrains collaboration, and distrusts shared data and services. Blockchain can fulfill these gaps and be a trusted decentralized controller entity based on a consensus mechanism among network participants. This Early-stage paper presents an initial doctoral research proposal on how to combine Blockchain with Systems-of-Systems concepts to provide trusted interoperability between Smart Cities systems.},

The event includes 3 days of cutting-edge research and practice on topics related to open collaboration. This proceedings of WikiSym 2010 are aimed to act as a permanent record of the conference activities. This year for the first time, WikiSym is co-located with Wikimania 2010, the international community conference of the Wikimedia Foundation projects, which is taking place right after WikiSym.The general program of WikiSym 2010 builds on the success of previous years, formally embracing different aspects of open collaboration research and practice. To support this, for the first time the program is divided into 3 complementary tracks, each focusing on a specific area of interest in this field. The Wiki Track includes contributions specifically dealing with research, deployment, use and management of wiki platforms and the communities around them. The Industry Track draws together practitioners, entrepreneurs and industry managers and employees to better understand open collaboration ecosystems in corporate environments. Finally, the Open Collaboration Track comprises all other aspects related to open cooperative initiatives and projects. Related to this, you will find a growing number of contributions dealing with nontechnical perspectives of open collaboration, such as debates on educational resources and sociopolitical aspects. You will also find the traditional technical papers, plus tutorials, workshops, panels and demos. The success of the new broadened scope of WikiSym reflects the very high interest in wikis and open collaboration existing today.Cliff Lampe from Michigan State University will be opening the symposium with a talk on "The Machine in the Ghost: a SocioTechnical Systems Approach to User-Generated Content Research". Likewise, Andrew Lih will be giving the closing keynote session on "What Hath Wikipedia Wrought". These represent only two of the talks and sessions that attendees will find at WikiSym 2010. Fortyone research papers were submitted this year to the academic program, and sixteen were accepted, for an acceptance rate of 39%. All papers were revised by at least three reviewers, though some of them had up to five different reviewers. Authors from accepted papers come from 18 different countries, showing the broad international impact of the conference.},

Recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. In this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the Betty's Brain system. We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) is a personalization technology that generates recommendations for users based on others' evaluations. CF is used by numerous e-commerce Web sites for providing personalized recommendations. Although much research has focused on refining collaborative filtering algorithms, little is known about the effects of user and domain characteristics on the accuracy of collaborative filtering systems. In this study, the effects of two factors—product domain and users' search mode—on the accuracy of CF are investigated. The effects of those factors are tested using data collected from two experiments in two different product domains, and from two large CF datasets, EachMovie and Book-Crossing. The study shows that the search mode of the users strongly influences the accuracy of the recommendations. CF works better when users look for specific information than when they search for general information. The accuracy drops significantly when data from different modes are mixed. The study also shows that CF is more accurate for knowledge domains than for consumer product domains. The results of this study imply that for more accurate recommendations, collaborative filtering systems should be able to identify and handle users' mode of search, even within the same domain and user group.},

Disruptions in the payment system can quickly lead to cascading effects and even the responses of actors in the various sectors are interrelated, which can cause escalation if the collaborative responses are not well-aligned. Our contribution to the track of Human Factors and simulation discusses how gaming-simulation can be used as a training environment where groups of practitioners can learn to develop in-depth understanding of system behaviour (i.e. cascading effects of disruptions) and learn how to develop collaborative resilience across many different critical infrastructures. More specifically, our paper focuses on the development and application of a mixed-methods assessment approach in the simulation-game. The assessment method captures qualitative as well as quantitative aspects of resilience and team-work. It can be used to assess the value of our simulation-game and to increase insight in what collective resilience actually implies.},

abstract = {Pair Programming (PP) is an Agile software development methodology that involves two developers working together on a single computer. However, the physical presence of two developers has become a challenge in recent years due to the pandemic, necessitating remote collaboration methods such as Distributed Pair Programming (DPP). DPP has been found to have similar benefits to in-person PP, but the issue of team compatibility remains unresolved. These are more evident in the educational field of Agile methodologies. To address these challenges, we developed a novel approach by creating a Mixed Reality (MR) application that enables users to learn PP with the assistance of a conversational intelligent virtual avatar. The application uses the HoloLens MR device and a Conversational Agent (CA) extension integrated into Visual Studio Code to provide suggestions for improving the code written by the user. The virtual avatar animates these suggestions, making it appear to speak and interact with the user in real time. This system aims to overcome the limitations of common DPP methods, allowing a single developer to learn and apply the PP methodology even when a human partner is unavailable.},

What are the patterns of cross-domain collaborations? How do those collaborations form?

All these patterns violate fundamental assumptions of traditional recommendation systems.In this paper, we analyze the cross-domain collaboration data from research publications and confirm the above patterns. We propose the Cross-domain Topic Learning (CTL) model to address these challenges. For handling sparse connections, CTL consolidates the existing cross-domain collaborations through topic layers instead of at author layers, which alleviates the sparseness issue. For handling complementary expertise, CTL models topic distributions from source and target domains separately, as well as the correlation across domains. For handling topic skewness, CTL only models relevant topics to the cross-domain collaboration.We compare CTL with several baseline approaches on large publication datasets from different domains. CTL outperforms baselines significantly on multiple recommendation metrics. Beyond accurate recommendation performance, CTL is also insensitive to parameter tuning as confirmed in the sensitivity analysis.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) based recommender systems often suffer from the sparsity problem, particularly for new and inactive users when they use the system. The emerging trend of social networking sites and their accommodation in other sites like e-commerce can potentially help alleviate the sparsity problem with their provided social relation data. In this paper, we have particularly explored a new kind of social relation, the membership, and its combined effect with friendship. The two type of heterogeneous social relations are fused into the CF recommender via a factorization process. Due to the two relations' respective properties, we adopt different fusion strategies: regularization was leveraged for friendship and collective matrix factorization (CMF) was proposed for incorporating membership. We further developed a unified model to combine the two relations together and tested it with real large-scale datasets at five sparsity levels. The experiment has not only revealed the significant effect of the two relations, especially the membership, in augmenting recommendation accuracy in the sparse data condition, but also identified the ability of our fusing model in achieving the desired fusion performance.},

abstract = {As the number, complexity, and heterogeneity of connected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) increase, so does our need to secure these devices, the environment in which they operate, and the assets they manage or control. Collaborative security exploits the capabilities of these connected devices and opportunistically composes them to protect assets from potential harm. By dynamically composing these capabilities, collaborative security implements the security controls that satisfy both security and non-security requirements. However, this dynamic composition is often hampered by the heterogeneity of the devices available in the environment and the diversity of their behaviours. In this article, we present a systematic, tool-supported approach for collaborative security where the analysis of requirements drives the opportunistic composition of capabilities to realise the appropriate security control in the operating environment. This opportunistic composition is supported through a combination of feature modelling and mediator synthesis. We use features and transition systems to represent and reason about capabilities and requirements. We formulate the selection of the optimal set of features to implement adequate security control as a multi-objective constrained optimisation problem and use constraint programming to solve it efficiently. The selected features are then used to scope the behaviours of the capabilities and thereby restrict the state space for synthesising the appropriate mediator. The synthesised mediator coordinates the behaviours of the capabilities to satisfy the behaviour specified by the security control. Our approach ensures that the implemented security controls are the optimal ones, given the capabilities available in the operating environment. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by implementing a feature-driven mediation for collaborative security tool and applying it to a collaborative robots case study.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks (WSANs) are composed of a large number of heterogeneous nodes called sensors and actors. The collaborative operation of sensors enables the distributed sensing of a physical phenomenon, while the role of actors is to collect and process sensor data and perform appropriate actions.In this paper, a coordination framework for WSANs is addressed. A new sensor-actor coordination model is proposed, based on an event-driven clustering paradigm in which cluster formation is triggered by an event so that clusters are created on-the-fly to optimally react to the event itself and provide the required reliability with minimum energy expenditure. The optimal solution is determined by mathematical programming and a distributed solution is also proposed. In addition, a new model for actor-actor coordination is introduced for a class of coordination problems in which the area to be acted upon is optimally split among different actors. An auction-based distributed solution of the problem is also presented.Performance evaluation shows how global network objectives, such as compliance with real-time constraints and minimum energy consumption, can be reached in the proposed framework with simple interactions between sensors and actors that are suitable for large-scale networks of energy-constrained devices.},

abstract = {Interaction designers are increasingly faced with the challenge of creating interfaces that incorporate multiple input modalities, such as pen and speech, and span multiple devices. Few early stage prototyping tools allow non-programmers to prototype these interfaces. Here we describe CrossWeaver, a tool for informally prototyping multimodal, multidevice user interfaces. This tool embodies the informal prototyping paradigm, leaving design representations in an informal, sketched form, and creates a working prototype from these sketches. CrossWeaver allows a user interface designer to sketch storyboard scenes on the computer, specifying simple multimodal command transitions between scenes. The tool also allows scenes to target different output devices. Prototypes can run across multiple standalone devices simultaneously, processing multimodal input from each one. Thus, a designer can visually create a multimodal prototype for a collaborative meeting or classroom application. CrossWeaver captures all of the user interaction when running a test of a prototype. This input log can quickly be viewed visually for the details of the users' multimodal interaction or it can be replayed across all participating devices, giving the designer information to help him or her analyze and iterate on the interface design.},

abstract = {Context: Interoperability is a crucial non-functional requirement for current information systems since systems can collaborate, exchange information, and use the information that has been shared. Interoperability has many types, such as semantic, legal, cultural, and organizational. Several interoperability types arose to characterize distinct information systems collaboration heterogeneity and barriers. Problem: However, various interoperability types do not have a common shared definition, leading to ambiguity and hampering developers from having a comprehensive view of the interoperability requirements they hope to achieve. Solution: We propose a conceptual model to describe and classify interoperability types reported in the scientific literature. This model aims to support developers in identifying interoperability types required in a given collaboration among information systems. IS Theory: We followed the design theory regarding the artifacts that contribute to the construction of IS. Method: The conceptual model was specified based on evidence collected from the scientific literature. It comprises two diagrams that describe and classify the interoperability types. We conducted a exploratory study with 33 information systems developers to validate our proposed conceptual model. Summary of Results: The conceptual model achieved 87.9% acceptance for the classification diagram, while the description diagram had 78.8% acceptance. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: This research work may help to comprehend how developers understand and use interoperability requirement specifications that require a particular solution to be fulfilled in an information system. In addition, this work also aims to contribute to the Full Interoperability and Systems-of-Systems Interoperability (SOSI) challenges proposed in I GrandSI-BR: 2016-2026.

When collaborators are remote, coordinating the sharing of views of their physical environment becomes challenging. Video-conferencing tools often do not provide the desired viewpoints for a remote viewer. While RGB-D cameras offer 3D views, they lack the necessary fidelity. We introduce SharedNeRF, designed to enhance synchronous remote collaboration by leveraging the photorealistic and view-dependent nature of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The system complements the higher visual quality of the NeRF rendering with the instantaneity of a point cloud and combines them through carefully accommodating the dynamic elements within the shared space, such as hand gestures and moving objects. The system employs a head-mounted camera for data collection, creating a volumetric task space on the fly and updating it as the task space changes. In our preliminary study, participants successfully completed a flower arrangement task, benefiting from SharedNeRF’s ability to render the space in high fidelity from various viewpoints.},

abstract = {Three of the most common approaches used in recommender systems are content-based filtering (matching users’ preferences with products’ characteristics), collaborative filtering (matching users with similar preferences), and demographic filtering (catering to users based on demographic characteristics). Do users’ intuitions lead them to trust one of these approaches over others, independent of the actual operations of these different systems? Does their faith in one type or another depend on the quality of the recommendation, rather than how the recommendation appears to have been derived? We conducted an empirical study with a prototype of a movie recommender system to find out. A 3 (Ostensible Recommender Type: Content vs. Collaborative vs. Demographic Filtering) x 2 (Recommendation Quality: Good vs. Bad) experiment (N=226) investigated how users evaluate systems and attribute responsibility for the recommendations they receive. We found that users trust systems that use collaborative filtering more, regardless of the system's performance. They think that they themselves are responsible for good recommendations but that the system is responsible for bad recommendations (reflecting a self-serving bias). Theoretical insights, design implications and practical solutions for the cold start problem are discussed.},

abstract = {Currently, the interest in Ambient Intelligence (or AmI) has increased exponentially due to the widespread use of portable devices. Users demand more and more functionality from these devices, especially in order to perform collaborative tasks and interchange information. As a result, this technology proposes new challenges that must be addressed by both the hardware manufacturers and Software Engineers. The first challenge is to provide a middleware platform providing specific AmI services like communication or device discovery and able to cope with several challenges posed by AmI applications. One of these challenges is to manage heterogeneity of devices that are present in AmI environments in a transparent way, and in particular to manage the evolution of such devices without breaking the code of already developed applications. Moreover, an AmI middleware platform has to support the evolution of the software architecture of AmI applications over time, making it possible to add new functionalities, to adapt applications to any technological changes, and to produce a product line of AmI platforms to be executed in different devices. A final challenge is that the middleware platform has to support the adaptation of AmI applications to unexpected and dynamic changes in AmI environments. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) provides good and advanced solutions to the evolution management problem at different levels, so our work focuses on applying AOP to develop an AmI platform. In this paper, we will discuss these problems, propose solutions and present how these problems are handled in our AmI aspect-oriented platform named AOPAmI. This paper describes the internal platform structure and how it provides support to AmI devices. We will focus on the dynamic nature of AmI applications and on how to solve the above mentioned problems.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming a worldwide network of interconnected things that are uniquely addressable, via standard communication protocols. The use of IoT for continuous monitoring of public health is being rapidly adopted by various countries while generating a massive volume of heterogeneous, multisource, dynamic, and sparse high-velocity data. Handling such an enormous amount of high-speed medical data while integrating, collecting, processing, analyzing, and extracting knowledge constitutes a challenging task. On the other hand, most of the existing IoT devices do not cooperate with one another by using the same medium of communication. For this reason, it is a challenging task to develop healthcare applications for IoT that fulfill all user needs through real-time monitoring of health parameters. Therefore, to address such issues, this article proposed a Hadoop-based intelligent care system (HICS) that demonstrates IoT-based collaborative contextual Big Data sharing among all of the devices in a healthcare system. In particular, the proposed system involves a network architecture with enhanced processing features for data collection generated by millions of connected devices. In the proposed system, various sensors, such as wearable devices, are attached to the human body and measure health parameters and transmit them to a primary mobile device (PMD). The collected data are then forwarded to intelligent building (IB) using the Internet where the data are thoroughly analyzed to identify abnormal and serious health conditions. Intelligent building consists of (1) a Big Data collection unit (used for data collection, filtration, and load balancing); (2) a Hadoop processing unit (HPU) (composed of Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce); and (3) an analysis and decision unit. The HPU, analysis, and decision unit are equipped with a medical expert system, which reads the sensor data and performs actions in the case of an emergency situation. To demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed system, we use publicly available medical sensory datasets and real-time sensor traffic while identifying the serious health conditions of patients by using thresholds, statistical methods, and machine-learning techniques. The results show that the proposed system is very efficient and able to process high-speed WBAN sensory data in real time.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design and use of Cimetric, a file synchronization application that supports scholarly collaboration. The system design incorporates results of earlier studies that suggest replicating content on a user's personal devices may have different characteristics than replicating content to share it with collaborators. To realize this distinction, Cimetric performs bi-level synchronization: it synchronizes local copies of a versioned repository among collaborators' computers, while it separately synchronizes private working files between each user's personal devices. Through a year's worth of in-house use of Cimetric in a variety of configurations, we were able to investigate key file synchronization issues, including the role of cloud storage given the ability to sync between peers; the strengths and weaknesses of a bi-level design; and which aspects of the synchronization process to reveal to users.},

abstract = {The beta phase of the 11th revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) intends to accept public input through a distributed model of crowdsourcing. One of the core use cases is to create textual definitions for the ICD categories. The objective of the present study is to design, develop and evaluate approaches to support ICD-11 textual definitions authoring using Semantic Web technology. We investigated a number of heterogeneous resources related to the definitions of diseases, including the linked open data (LOD) from DBpedia, the textual definitions from the UMLS and the formal definitions of SNOMED CT. We integrated them in a Semantic Web framework (i.e. linked data in a RDF triple store), which is being proposed as a backend in a prototype platform for collaborative authoring of ICD-11 beta. We performed a preliminary evaluation on the usefulness of our approaches and discussed the potential challenges from both technical and clinical perspectives.},

abstract = {Although physical prototyping platforms such as Arduino have significantly lowered the barrier for the development of standalone networked smart things, it still remains very challenging to create multi-device environments in which heterogeneous devices collaborate in smart ways to assist their users. However, with the ever growing number of networked smart things in our home, office and public environments it becomes more and more important to practically explore the opportunities that these device ecologies can potentially offer in the future. With meSchup we present an IoT prototyping platform that drastically reduces the effort and time for the creation and exploration of smart multi-device environments. We show a novel interaction script approach that interweaves arbitrary devices in real time and introduce interactive programming by demonstrations features integrated in a single web based IDE. We finally illustrate three exemplary use cases that indicate the wide range of possible applications.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 has provided organizations remarkable opportunities to improve productivity, gain competitive advantage, and increase participation by engaging a crowd to accomplish tasks at scale. However, establishing and integrating crowd-based systems into organizations is still an open question. The systems and the collaborative processes they enable appear diametrically in dissonance with the norms and culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing in traditional organizations. They require mechanisms for articulation of work, coordination, cooperation, and knowledge co-creation that are fundamentally different from those in current groupwork systems and processes. Building on two workshops hosted at ACM CSCW 2014, we will explore questions such as: How does the shift in organizational work from a closed system with known individuals, to an open and crowd model that requires engagement with an undefined network of people, affect how we conceptualize groupwork? What are the implications for the design of groupwork systems? What can the crowdsourcing research community learn from groupwork systems, or conversely what can groupwork researchers learn from crowdsourcing? How do cultures, motivations, ownership and representation fit into these systems? This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners in crowdsourcing, social computing, collaborative technologies, organizational science, and workplace research, to discuss the future of groupwork systems in the era of crowdwork with the goal of articulating an agenda for future research.},

abstract = {The field of multimedia is dedicated to research and studies that leverage multiple modalities of signals and data in developing intelligent systems and technologies. Be it search engine, recommendation system, streaming service, interactive agent, or collaborative system, multimedia plays a critical role in ensuring full understanding of multimodal sensory signals, robust modeling of user-content interaction, natural and rich communication experience, and scalable system deployment. The goal is to utilize unique contributions from each modality, integrate complementary synergies, and achieve the best performance and novel functions beyond what's separately available in each individual medium. In this community, most contributors also maintain strong activities in other disciplines such as networking, computer vision, human-computer interaction, and machine learning. But the field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.The field enjoys a long history of vibrant research. For example, the flagship ACM SIGMM Multimedia Conference was established in 1993, celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. The community also has several well-known conferences and journals organized by ACM, IEEE, and other groups, attracting a large number of researchers and practitioners from around the world. However, despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, there has been less effort toward developing books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics in this broad field. Most of the few books available today either focus on specific subfields or basic background. There is a lack of tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field.SIGMM launched a new initiative to address this need in 2015, by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia to deliver plenary tutorial style talks at ACM Multimedia 2015. Each speaker discussed challenges and the state of the art within their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. Topics covered were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment. Following the very positive responses to the talks, these rising-star speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks to chapters that can be used as reference materials for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each resulting chapter discusses problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising directions for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs by providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics of multimedia.Section 1 of the book includes five chapters that are focused on analysis and understanding of multimedia content. Topics covered range from analysis of video content, audio content, multimodal content about interaction of freestanding conversational groups, and analysis of multimedia data in the encrypted format for preserving privacy on cloud servers, to efficient approximate similarity search techniques for searching over large-scale databases.First, Zuxuan Wu et al. review current research on understanding video content by detecting the classes of actions or events contained in a given video clip and generation of full-sentence captions describing the content in each such video. Unlike previous surveys, this review focuses on solutions based on deep learning, reflecting the recent trend of research in this area. The chapter also gives extensive reviews of the datasets used in state-of-the-art research and benchmarking efforts.Extending the modality from video to audio, in Chapter 2, Gerald Friedland et al. introduce the field of computer audition, aiming to develop the theory behind artificial systems that can extract information from sound. This chapter reviews the research datasets available, appropriate representations needed for audio, and a few challenging problems such as automatic extraction of hierarchical semantic structures from audio content and automatic discovery of high-level semantic concepts from massive audio data and associated metadata.The holy grail of research for the multimedia community is to be able to integrate and fuse information extracted from multiple modalities of data. In Chapter 3, Xavier Alameda-Pineda et al. present an excellent example and emergent research challenges in the application of detecting social interaction among freestanding conversational groups. The chapter includes overviews of research issues, approaches, evaluation of joint estimation of head and body poses using multiPreface modality data (such as wearable sensors and distributed camera networks), and results of detecting dynamic group formation of interacting people.Chapter 4 addresses a novel emerging topic prompted by the popular approach to multimedia analysis using cloud computing servers. When multimedia data is sent to the cloud for storage or processing, there is a risk of privacy breach via unauthorized access by third parties to the content in the cloud. Pradeep Atrey et al. review state-of-the-art methods and open issues for processing multimedia content in the encrypted domain without needing to convert data to the original format. This allows content to stay in its protected form while useful analysis is performed on it.In Chapter 5, Herv\'{e}e Jeundefinedou surveys efficient techniques for finding approximate solutions for similarity search, which is of particular interest when searching massive multimedia data like images, videos, and audio recordings. Jeundefinedou considers various performance factors like query speed, memory requirement, and search accuracy. Multiple frameworks based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH), quantization/ compression, and hybrid combinations are also reviewed in a coherent manner.In Section 2 of the book, the emphasis shifts from content analysis to humancentered aspects of multimedia computing. This new focus goes beyond extraction of semantic information from multimedia data. Instead, the broad research scope incorporates understanding of users and user-content interaction so as to improve effectiveness of multimedia systems in many applications, such as search and recommendation.Under the human-centric theme, Chapter 6, authored by Peng Cui, discusses the evolution of multimedia computing paradigms from the data-centric, to the content-centric, and recently to the human-centric. Cui presents a new framework, called social-sensed multimedia computing, to capture many key issues involved and advances achieved, including understanding of user-content interaction behavior, understanding of user intent, multimedia representation considering user intention, and integration of heterogeneous data sensed on multimedia social networks.Chapter 7 follows the human-centric theme and further moves the focus from processing individual multimedia data streams to processing a large number of heterogeneous streams in different modalities involving a large number of people. Analysis of such massive streams offers the possibility of detecting important situations of society, such as socio-economic affairs, as well as the living environment. Vivek Singh provides an overview of the problem definition, research framework, and the EventShop toolkit he developed for application development in this emerging area.The extension to the human-centric computing paradigm also calls for formal mathematical theories and tools for explaining the phenomena observed, such as the information propagation behaviors and the occurrences of information cascades on social networks. In Chapter 8, Marian-Andrei Rizoiu et al. review stochastic processes such as the Hawkes point process for modeling discrete, interdependent events over continuous time. These are strongly related to patterns corresponding to retweet cascade events on social media. Successful models like these can help researchers understand information dissemination patterns and predict popularity on social media.Interaction between users and content reveals not only the intent of the user (covered in Chapter 6), but also attributes of the content as well as of the user him/herself. Such interaction can be manifested in multiple forms including explicit cues such as visual and verbal expressions, and implicit cues such as eye movement and physiological signals like brain activity and heart rate. Chapter 9 includes a survey by Subramanian Ramanathan et al. on how such implicit user interaction cues can be explored to improve analysis of content (scene understanding) and user (user emotion recognition).To support research and development of emerging multimedia topics discussed above, there is a critical need for new generations of communication and computing systems that take into account the unique requirements of multimedia, such as real-time, high bandwidth, distributiveness, major power consumption, and resource uncertainty. The popular cloud-based computing systems, though prevalent formanyapplications, are not suitable for large-scale multimedia applications such as cloud-based gaming service and animation rendering service.The last section of the book focuses on the systems aspect, covering distinct topics of multimedia fog computing (Chapter 10) and cloud gaming (Chapter 11). Cheng-Hsin Hsu et al. survey the emerging paradigm focused on fog computing, in which computing services are crowdsourced to the edge nodes or even to the client devices on the user end. This offers major potential benefits in terms of low latency, location awareness, scalability, and heterogeneity. However, it also poses many significant challenges in areas such as resource discovery, resource allocation and management, quality of service, and security. Discussion of these challenges, along with recent advances in this area, are presented in Chapter 10.Finally, as a concrete example of large-scale distributed multimedia computing systems, Chapter 11 (by Kuan-Ta Chen et al.) presents a comprehensive survey of cloud gaming, with emphasis on the development of platform and testbed, test scenarios, and evaluation of performance, in order to enhance optimal design of various components of the complex cloud gaming systems. In particular, the chapter overviews extensive research in areas such as open-source platforms, cloud deployment, client design, and communication between gaming servers and clients.The scope of this book is by no means exhaustive or complete. For example, it can be expanded to include other important topics such as (but not limited to) multimedia content generation, multimodal knowledge discovery and representation, multimedia immersive networked environments, and applications in areas like healthcare, learning, and infrastructure. Nonetheless, the comprehensive survey materials already covered in the book provide an excellent foundation for exploring additional topics mentioned above, and many other relevant fields.We would like to give sincere acknowledgment to Dr. Svebor Karaman, who has provided tremendous assistance in communicating with contributors and organizing the content of this book.

Recent advances in technology open a range of opportunities for designing new and innovative collaborative mixed reality games, but also raise questions around design, technical requirements, immersion, safety, and player experience. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers, designers, practitioners, and players to identify the most pressing challenges that need to be addressed in the next decade, discuss opportunities to overcome these challenges, and highlight lessons learned from past designs of such games. Participants will present their ideas, assemble and discuss a collection of related papers, outline a unifying research agenda, and engage in an outdoor game ideation and prototyping session. We anticipate that the CSCW community can contribute to designing the next generation of collaborative mixed reality games and technologies and to support the growth of research and development in this exciting and emerging area.},

abstract = {Via audiovisual communications and a controllable physical embodiment, Mobile Robotic telePresence (MRP) systems aim to support enhanced collaboration between remote and local members of a given setting. But MRP systems also put the remote user in positions where they frequently rely on the help of local partners. Getting or 'recruiting' such help can be done with various verbal and embodied actions ranging in explicitness. In this paper, we look at how such recruitment occurs in video data drawn from an experiment where pairs of participants (one local, one remote) performed a timed searching task. We find a prevalence of implicit recruitment methods and outline obstacles to effective recruitment that emerge due to communicative asymmetries that are built into MRP design. In a future where remote work becomes widespread, assistance through remote work technology like MRPs needs close examination at a fundamental interactional level, taking into account how communicative asymmetries are at play in everyday use of such technologies.},

abstract = {The world is entering a new normal of hybrid organisations, in which it will be common that some members are co-located and others are remote. Hybridity is rife with asymmetries that affect our sense of belonging in an organisational space. This paper reports a study of an XR Telepresence technology probe to explore how remote workers might present themselves and be perceived as an equal and unique embodied being in a workplace. VROOM (Virtual Robot Overlay for Online Meetings) augments a standard Mobile Robotic Telepresence experience by (1) adding a virtual avatar overlay of the remote person to the local space, viewable through a HoloLens worn by the local user, through which the remote user can gesture and express themselves, and (2) giving the remote user an immersive 360° view of the local space, captured by a 360° camera on the robot, which they can view through a VR headset. We ran a study to understand how pairs of participants (one local and one remote) collaborate using VROOM in a search and word-guessing game. Our findings illustrate that there is much potential for a system like VROOM to support dynamic collaborative activities in which embodiment, gesturing, mobility, spatial awareness, and non-verbal expressions are important. However, there are also challenges to be addressed, specifically around proprioception, the mixing of a physical robot body with a virtual human avatar, uncertainties of others' views and capabilities, fidelity of expressions, and the appearance of the avatar. We conclude with further design suggestions and recommendations for future work.},

abstract = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables heterogeneous edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without revealing their raw data to a logically centralized server. However, beyond the heterogeneous device capacity, FL participants often exhibit differences in their data distributions, which are not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). Many existing works present point solutions to address issues like slow convergence, low final accuracy, and bias in FL, all stemming from client heterogeneity.In this paper, we explore an additional layer of complexity to mitigate such heterogeneity by grouping clients with statistically similar data distributions (cohorts). We propose Auxo to gradually identify such cohorts in large-scale, low-availability, and resource-constrained FL populations. Auxo then adaptively determines how to train cohort-specific models in order to achieve better model performance and ensure resource efficiency. Our extensive evaluations show that, by identifying cohorts with smaller heterogeneity and performing efficient cohort-based training, Auxo boosts various existing FL solutions in terms of final accuracy (2.1%--8.2%), convergence time (up to 2.2\texttimes{}), and model bias (4.8% - 53.8%).},

The myriad uses for wikis and figuring out how to use them can be overwhelming.At SUNY Geneseo, we use two different wikis to address two different technical requirements. One wiki is for internal documentation used by Computing &amp; Information Technology (CIT). The other wiki is a college-wide wiki system where any department or individual can have a wiki for whatever subject they wish. The college ¬wide wiki system was installed two years ago and has many uses such as documentation, collaborative writing, committee work, communication, and education.We have addressed many problems along the way including administration, policies, technical issues, education, adoption, and advocacy. Much of what we have overcome can help other IT departments looking to install a wiki or to get their existing wiki to be more widely accepted and adopted. We will also show some of the unique and interesting ways our wiki is being used.},

The CyberWater framework extends the open-data open-model framework called Meta-Scientific-Modeling (MSM) that provides a system-wide data and model integration platform. On top of MSM, the CyberWater framework provides a set of toolkits, and external system integration engines, to further facilitate users' scientific modeling and collaboration across disciplines. For example, the developed generic model agent toolkit enables users to integrate their computational models into CyberWater via graphical user interface configuration without coding, which further simplifies the data and model integration and model coupling. CyberWater adopts a graphical scientific workflow system, VisTrails, ensuring data provenance and reproducible computing. CyberWater supports novel access to high-performance computing resources on demand for users' computational expensive model tasks. We demonstrate merits of CyberWater by a use case of hydrologic modeling workflow.},

Massive use of smartphones, tablets, and other portable computing devices is reshaping the world of learning. Novel educational tools provide means to visualize and interact with compelling media, creating a virtual and augmented reality that can greatly enhance the knowledge transfer [5]. Education is also benefiting from various collaborative scenarios where students work together to overcome challenges while improving cognitive and social skills [3]. Indeed, as a way to improve learning, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already become an indispensable component of modern educational systems [2]. ICT brings a wealth of online features such as short messaging and chats, forums and groups, IP voice and video calls, cloud-based interactions and shared storage, etc., but it also forces students to focus on the screens of their computing devices and use the content to perform instruction-bound and other tasks. Therefore, despite all benefits that ICT brings to education, it could also have a negative impact on the learning process as it might restrict natural interactions thus isolating students and limiting their experience [1]. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of using heterogeneous computing paradigms (mobile devices and tabletop computers) in a collaborative learning environment.},

abstract = {The introduction of digital technologies into the practices of documentation, analysis and dissemination of cultural heritage is today an important issue not only in the sphere of computer science, but also in the humanities and social sciences as well as in conservation sciences. New scientific challenges are today at the crossroads of a few trends that shape the contemporary landscape of digital humanities: the democratisation of 3D digitisation means, the emergence of new approaches for the massive cross-analysis of digitised content, the on-going harmonisation of heritage information systems through the formalisation of multidisciplinary knowledge. Whilst recent advances in digital technologies have made it possible to introduce new tools that are making documentation practices evolve within the cultural heritage community, the management of multi-dimensional and multi-format data introduces new challenges, in particular the development of relevant analysis and interpretation methods, the sharing and correlation of heterogeneous data among several actors and contexts, and the centralised archiving of documentation results for long-term preservation purposes. The restoration of Notre-Dame de Paris is today an unprecedented opportunity to gather and analyse the many analytical and documentary resources produced by a large number of scientists and heritage professionals from different backgrounds on the same building. In collaboration with the other working groups of the french CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research) / MC (Ministry of Culture) task force on the restoration of the cathedral (stone, stained glass, wood, metals, structure, acoustics, heritage emotions, etc.), the "digital data" WG focuses on the introduction of an innovative digital ecosystem - a 'Notre-Dame de Paris' digital twin - to bring together, analyse and correlate the multiple levels of reading that converge towards the production of new knowledge on the cathedral, its transformations over time, its materials, the alterations produced by the fire, as well as towards the restoration project. By combining recent advances in 3D digitisation, knowledge engineering, computer vision and shape analysis, our approach will take into account two complementary aspects. On the one hand, the description of the different steps taken by scientists to move from the observation of raw data to their interpretation in relation to other contextual data from the analysis of typical operating chains. On the other hand, the analysis of the spatial, temporal and semantic overlap of regions of "multidisciplinary interest" based on the correlation of annotations, vocabulary terms, qualitative attributes and morphological features.},

The research is based upon HCI theory, aided by general theories of embodied cognition, embodiment and developmental psychology. The main setting of the research is large scale floor-projected mixed environments, which will allow for testing interaction strategies and evaluation methods of experiences based on collocation of multiple users within a full-body interactive scenario, where they can practice interaction in a natural and uninhibited manner. The research consists of designing playful experiences for the target users in order to promote socialization, collaboration and social inclusion. Topics for analysis include understanding the dynamics of goal-oriented and open-ended gameplay, proxemics, and encouraged group collaboration, on the design of these systems. Assessment methods take into account multimodal analysis, including physiology-based data such as electrodermal activity and heart rate, of the children's behavioral and affective states in the experience.},

abstract = {Web-Based Simulation (WBS) is a key component for collaborative work in cyberspace between the users who are separated geographically. Traditional WBS nevertheless has limitations in showing the changes made by the participants in the model development in real-time. Common in most frameworks is posting the result after the changes. While this method can be of some benefit for the users of Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S), it has significant drawbacks for true collaborative applications such as Virtual Training Environment (VTE), Virtual Classrooms, and Virtual Labs.Our framework in contrast provides a shared view of the entire M&amp;S process in real-time to all of its participants in the virtual environment. In addition, it also allows its participants to share editing of the simulation model via Mob-Write Share-Edit techniques (MWSE). The platform supports Advanced Distance Learning (ADL) where the students join the training session, collaboratively work on their task, launch and interact with their model of choice, select their simulation engine for executions, and perform their training tasks.This paper describes a prototype implementation of the framework. It currently supports three different simulation engines while others can easily be integrated in the system. Furthermore, the paper provides several benchmark examples developed in this prototype and added to the repository.},

The core idea is to adopt the view of documentation as boundary objects: shared artefacts that maintain integrity across a project's intersecting social worlds. The paper presents a case study, in which interviews with system engineers and designers were analysed to obtain requirements on an architectural description serving as boundary objects in a telecommunications project. The main result is a list of 18 empirically grounded, elementary requirements, worth considering when implementing lean and agile processes in the large.},

year = {2012},
isbn = {9781467312981},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Powered by cloud computing, Dropbox not only provides reliable file storage but also enables effective file synchronization and user collaboration. This new generation of service, beyond conventional client/server or peer-to-peer file hosting with storage only, has attracted a vast number of Internet users. It is however known that the synchronization delay of Dropbox-like systems is increasing with their expansion, often beyond the accepted level for practical collaboration. In this paper, we present an initial measurement to understand the design and performance bottleneck of the proprietary Dropbox system. Our measurement identifies the cloud servers/instances utilized by Dropbox, revealing its hybrid design with both Amazon's S3 (for storage) and Amazon's EC2 (for computation). The mix of bandwidth-intensive tasks (such as content delivery) and computation-intensive tasks (such as compare hash values for the contents) in Dropbox enables seamless collaborationand file synchronization among multiple users; yet their interference, revealed in our experiments, creates a severe bottleneck that prolongs the synchronization delay with virtual machines in the cloud, which has not seen in conventional physical machines. We thus re-model the resource provisioning problem in the Dropbox-like systems and present an interference-aware solution that smartly allocates the Dropbox tasks to different cloud instances. Evaluation results show that our solution remarkably reduces the synchronization delay for this new generation of file hosting service.},

abstract = {The complexity of mechatronic systems is vastly increasing. Therefore, the design of these systems requires different engineering domains, e.g., the mechanical, electrical, and control domains, to work together. The different domains often work in parallel to gain efficiency in this so-called co-design process. However, the design choices made by engineers in one domain can influence parameters in another domain. Too little or even no knowledge about these cross-domain influences may later lead to system integration problems or to degraded system performance. Solving these problems requires taking steps back in the development process, causing a higher design cost. In order to improve this cross-domain collaboration, we propose using ontologies to assist the co-design process by explicitly capturing the design dependencies, both within and across the engineering domains. However, designing ontologies can be complex and is labor-intensive, especially if one relies on generic ontology languages like the Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL 2). Therefore, we created a Domain Specific Language (DSL) focusing on the essential complexity, which enables engineers to design a cross-domain system ontology in a consistent and straightforward way. We elaborate on the metamodel for this DSL, discuss the realization of a prototype tool, and demonstrate how one can then reason on this ontology to derive new information about the various cross-domain design relationships.},

abstract = {In the future, cyber-physical systems (CPS) will increasingly need to have the capability to collaborate with other CPS during runtime to fulfill an overall purpose. This is, for instance, the case for autonomous driving where individual vehicles form a platoon in order to reduce energy consumption and improve the overall traffic flow. When engineering such CPS, it is important to understand the goals the individual systems should fulfill as well as the goals of collaborating groups the individual CPS are potentially part of during operation. In this context, the use of goal modeling techniques seems promising to systematically identify, document, and analyze the scope and context of individual CPS and groups of collaborating CPS in terms of goals and goal relationships. Even though many approaches for goal modeling have been proposed, only a few of them already found their way to industry - such as GRL (goal-oriented requirements language), which is also the essential part of the ITU Z.150/151 standard. In this paper, we report on empirical insights gained from applying the GRL for goal modeling of collaborative groups of CPS in the application fields 'autonomous driving' and 'collaborative transport robots'. We explore different challenges that originate from the very nature of dynamical collaboration of CPS and report on our findings from applying GRL in this context. In order to facilitate goal modeling for individual CPS and collaborative groups thereof, we also propose extensions to GRL addressing specific limitations of GRL identified in our studies.},

abstract = {Past investigations have recorded the utilisation of administrative claim data for medical care research purposes. Also, administrative claim data uncovers massive professional networks among medical services providers, such as information and knowledge sharing. During care for patients, the connection among providers makes a considerable commitment to efficient health results. Patient-sharing provider networks (PSN) as a joint effort are new and analysed to investigate their effect on medical services results; the impact of such collaborative efforts is yet unidentified. This study aims to analyse PSN for different suburbs of the Macarthur region in New South Wales (NSW), Australia and explore health care collaboration between patients and providers. It has illustrated the usefulness of analysing this network and its applications in studying the collaborative efforts of patients and different healthcare service providers. It also has discussed patient satisfaction as it is one of the several ways to evaluate health service quality, composing an effective indicator to measure providers' success. In this context, determining the main factors contributing to patient satisfaction is crucial to improving quality in healthcare delivery. The corresponding literature suggests that socio-demographic characteristics play a vital role in patient satisfaction. Therefore, based on the social network analysis methodology, this paper measures the connections between gender, age, family status, level of education, incomes, living quality, and patient satisfaction in the Macarthur region. The findings and insights from this research can potentially help healthcare stakeholders formulate better policies, eventually improving the quality of care. The analyses conducted in this study illustrate the potential for using network analysis to provide new insights into the Australian healthcare system and opportunities for prompting future improvements.},

abstract = {Awareness of another's activity is an important aspect of facilitating collaboration between users, enabling an "understanding of the activities of others"[1]. Techniques such as collaborative filtering enable a form of asynchronous awareness, providing recommendations generated from the past activity of a community of users. In this paper we investigate the role of awareness and its effect on search behavior in collaborative multimedia retrieval. We focus on the scenario where two users are searching at the same time on the same task, and via the interface, can see the activity of the other user. The main research question asks: does awareness of another searcher aid a user when carrying out a multimedia search session?To encourage awareness, an experimental study was designed where two users were asked to find as many relevant video shots as possible under different awareness conditions. These were individual search (no awareness of each other), mutual awareness (where both user's could see each other's search screen), and unbalanced awareness (where one user is able to see the other's screen, but not vice-versa). Twelve pairs of users were recruited, and the four worst performing TRECVID 2006 search topics were used as search tasks, under four different awareness conditions. We present the results of this study, followed by a discussion of the implications for multimedia digital library systems.},

abstract = {Web Services and SOA provide interoperability and architectural baseline for flexible and dynamic cross enterprise collaborations, where execution and use of the participating services contributes to the common objective. Relationships within these collaborations are complex, with services joining and leaving throughout the life cycle, or the same services being offered in several collaborations simultaneously. This provides strong requirements for federated security, where integrity and confidentiality of the collaboration must be maintained through membership control, security policy enforcement and separation of web service instance interactions in different collaborations.In this paper we propose a new Web Services (WS) framework for managing and controlling WS interactions in a federated environment, leveraging on platform virtualisation architecture and the functionalities provided by trusted secure hardware. The framework allows configuring policies that define collaboration membership, and enforce access to the collaboration per-WS instance. In addition, since the access to the configurations is restricted, it provides masterslave model where only authorised administrative entity can modify any of the above - either at the deployment or at the execution time. Some of the benefits of the proposed approach are: fine-grained external exposure of WSs, a flexible model for group membership control and revocation and hardware-enabled secure virtualised system providing functional process isolation and strong data security.},

Raw data in EMRs are voluminous and heterogeneous. They need to be collected and stored to allow clinical management, treatment and to apply prevention protocols.

In collaboration with Biochemical Laboratory of the University Hospital, we designed a workflow based system to analyze biological values. The system is able to relate biological data to diagnosis codes and with additional information integrated and correlated to EMRs data. Prediction models have been used and tested on 3 specific diagnosis, proving that system is able to: (i) identify blood test features that are important to detect a pathology and (ii) finding correlations among patients features.},

We evaluate some corporate distributed teams with respect to a theory of remote scientific collaboration to identify similarities and differences in corporate contexts. Preliminary results indicate that distance collaboration in corporations differs from distance collaboration in scientific research in three key ways: (1) the importance of functional (as opposed to geographic) distance, (2) new collaboration paradigms (i.e. offshoring) with varying degrees of.otherness. and (3) different incentives. We additionally discuss future research plans based upon our initial findings.},

abstract = {Digital artifacts take increasingly prominent positions in the life of individuals, organizations and the society at large. This paper inquires into the effects of digitalization on the payment industry. In the case of payments, the ecosystem surrounding a payment historically involved two parties exchanging goods and services for money (banknotes and coins). Today, payment increasingly consists of digital representations of money in a globally intertwined system that involve many parties, such as payers, payment services providers, banks, telecom operators, mobile phone manufactures, and payees. We study how technological payment innovations influence the payment ecosystem, and find that digitalization has caused ecosystem turbulence by influencing competitive and collaborative dimensions of the ecosystem. The digitalization creates a new arena for competition that will require new collaboration forms among involved stockholders. In the extension, we find that future developments of the digital payment infrastructure are something very different from a traditional IT systems development project, which makes existing methods and approaches to systems development inadequate in addressing the challenge.},

abstract = {When children use webcams to conduct intercultural collaboration, communication efficiency is strongly influenced by social issues such as language and cultural differences and technical issues such as network delay. Current intercultural video-based collaboration sessions rely heavily on human facilitators and non-electronic tools, but the concept of providing system-based facilitation has not been well explored. Our extensive field observations indicate that intercultural webcam communication must be supported by five layers of facilitation. The five layers are, from top to bottom, the intercultural layer, collaboration layer, communication layer, network layer, and standalone layer. Each layer has a different form of facilitation and all are directed towards decreasing communication stress. Based on our observations, we propose a webcam platform that separates social issues from technical issues. We extend the normal video and audio channels with two redundant social channels: pictograms and machine translation. Visualization of technical measures of system performance such as network delay is introduced to facilitate users' awareness of the separation of technical issues and social issues and thus reduce communication stress.},

abstract = {Recently there has been an increasing interest on bootstrapping security for wireless networks merely using physical layer characteristics. In particular, the focus has been on two fundamental security issues - device authentication and secret key extraction. While most existing works emphasize on tackling the two issues separately, it remains an open problem to simultaneously achieve device authentication and fast secret key extraction merely using wireless physical layer characteristics, without the help of advanced hardware or out-of-band channel.In this paper, for the first time, we answer this open problem in the setting of Wireless Body Area Networks (BANs). We propose ASK-BAN, a lightweight fast authenticated secret key extraction scheme for intra-BAN communication. Our scheme neither introduces any advanced hardware nor relies on out-of-band channels. To perform device authentication and fast secret key extraction at the same time, we exploit the heterogeneous channel characteristics among the collection of on-body channels during body motion. Specifically, with simple body movements, channel variations between line-of-sight on-body devices are relatively stable while those for non-line-of-sight devices are unstable. ASK-BAN utilizes the relatively static channels for device authentication and the dynamic ones for secret key generation. On one hand, ASK-BAN achieves authentication through multi-hop stable channels, which greatly reduces the false positive rate as compared to existing work. On the other hand, based on dynamic channels, the key extraction process between two on-body devices with multi-hop relay nodes is modeled as a max-flow problem, and a novel collaborative secret key generation algorithm is introduced to maximize the key generation rate. Extensive real-world experiments on low-end COTS sensor devices validate that ASK-BAN has a high secret key generation rate while being able to authenticate body devices effectively.},

abstract = {This paper describes a tool that will allow public health analysts to estimate infectious disease risk at the country level as a function of different international transportation modes. The prototype focuses on a cholera epidemic originating within Latin America or the Caribbean, but it can be expanded to consider other pathogens as well. This effort leverages previous work in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop the International Travel to Community Impact (IT-CI) model, which analyzes and assesses potential international disease outbreaks then estimates the associated impacts to U.S. communities and the nation as a whole and orient it for use Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). For brevity, we refer to this refined model as OIT-CI. First, we developed an operationalized meta-population spatial cholera model for Latin America and the Caribbean at the secondary administrative-level boundary. Secondly, we developed a robust function of human airline critical to approximating mixing patterns in the meta-population model. In the prototype version currently presented here, OIT-CI models a cholera epidemic originating in a Latin American or Caribbean country and spreading via airline transportation routes. Disease spread is modeled at the country level using a patch model with a connectivity function based on demographic, geospatial, and human transportation data. We have also identified data to estimate the water and health-related infrastructure capabilities of each country to include this potential impact on disease transmission. OIT-CI utilizes these data and modeling constructs to estimate the cholera risk, as a function of attack rate, for each country consistent [1]. This estimation will be completed by providing an order of magnitude risk estimate (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, 50 percent, 100 percent) for a cholera outbreak originating within and spreading to Latin American and Caribbean countries at secondary level boundaries (i.e., states or administrative districts). To create a product that is both useful and desirable, feedback from end users of OIT-CI will be incorporated into the model software and visualization design.},

abstract = {Public libraries and coworking spaces seek for means to facilitate peer collaboration, peer inspiration and cross-pollination of skills and creativity. However, social learning, inspiration and collaboration between coworkers do not come naturally. In particular in (semi-) public spaces, the behavioural norm among unacquainted coworkers is to work in individual silos without taking advantage of social learning or collaboration opportunities. This paper presents results from a pilot study of 'Gelatine' -- a system that facilitates shared encounters between coworkers by allowing them to digitally 'check in' at a work space. Gelatine displays skills, areas of interest, and needs of currently present coworkers on a public screen. The results indicate that the system amplifies users' sense of place and awareness of other coworkers, and serves as an interface for social learning through exploratory, opportunistic and serendipitous inspirations, as well as through helping users identify like-minded peers for follow-up face-to-face encounters. We discuss how Gelatine is perceived by users with different pre-entry motivations, and discuss users' challenges as well as non-use of the system.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to present the Proceedings of the Ninth Annual ACM Conference on Learning at Scale, L@S 2022, held June 1-3, 2022 on Roosevelt Island, New York.L@S investigates large-scale, technology-mediated learning environments that typically have many active learners and few experts on hand to guide their progress or respond to individual needs. The conference was created by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), inspired by the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the accompanying shift in thinking about education. However, the conference has evolved over the years and is now one of the most relevant venues for discussion of the highest quality research on how learning and teaching can be transformed by that diversity of environments.Modern learning at scale typically draws on large amounts of data collected over time from a great variety of learning environments. That data is diverse and heterogeneous since it is collected from different learning situations. For example, institutional education in K-16 and campus-based courses in popular fields involve many learners, relative to the number of teaching staff, and leverage varying forms of data collection and automated support. The data is collected through a variety of learning environments enhanced by different technological support that are in constant transformation. Evolving forms of massive open online courses, hybrid learning environments combining online and face-to-face, collaborative synchronous and asynchronous learning activities, distributed as mobile and seamless learning applications, intelligent learning support or AI for education are examples of these evolving learning at scale environments, which combine innovative teaching and learning models with the latest technologies. Informal environments such as open courseware, learning games, citizen science communities, collaborative programming communities (e.g., Scratch), community tutorial systems (e.g., StackOverflow), shared critique communities (e.g., DeviantArt), and informal communities of learners (e.g., the Explain It Like I'm Five sub-Reddit) are modern large-scale environments that the community is also investigating. Research on learning at scale involves dealing with this diversity of data and technology-enhanced environments with a particular purpose: to increase human potential, leveraging data collection, data analysis, human interaction, and varying forms of computational assessment, adaptation, and guidance.},

abstract = {In this contribution we propose a hybrid recommendation framework based on classification algorithms such as Random Forests and Naive Bayes, which are fed with several heterogeneous groups of features. We split our features into two classes: classic features, as popularity-based, collaborative and content-based ones, and extended features gathered from the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, as basic ones (i.e. genre of a movie or the writer of a book) and graph-based features calculated on the ground of the different topological characteristics of the tripartite representation connecting users, items and properties in the LOD cloud. In the experimental session we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on varying of different groups of features, and results show that both LOD-based and graph-based features positively affect the overall performance of the algorithm, especially in highly sparse recommendation scenarios. Our approach also outperforms several state-of-the-art recommendation techniques, thus confirming the insights behind this research.

abstract = {The problem of selecting virtual objects within augmented reality on handheld devices has been tackled multiple times. However, evaluations were carried out on purely synthetic tasks with uniformly placed homogeneous objects, often located on a plane and with none or low occlusions. This paper presents two novel approaches to indirect object selection dealing with highly occluded objects with large spatial distribution variability and heterogeneous size and appearance. The methods are designed to enable long-term usage with a tablet-like device. One method is based on a spatially anchored hierarchy menu, and the other utilizes a crosshair and a side menu that shows candidate objects according to a custom-developed metric. The proposed approaches are compared with direct touch in the context of spatial visual programming of collaborative robots problem, on a realistic workplace and a common robotic task. The preliminary evaluation indicates that the main benefit of the proposed indirect methods could be their higher precision and higher selection confidence for the user.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a Mixed Reality (MR) remote collaboration system that enables hybrid view sharing from the local worker to the remote expert for real-time remote guidance. The local worker can share either a 2D first-person view, a 360° live view with a fixed viewpoint, or a 3D free view within a point-cloud reconstruction of the local environment. The remote expert can access these views and freely switch between them in Virtual Reality (VR) for better awareness of the local worker’s surroundings. We investigate the remote experts’ behaviours while using the hybrid view interface during typical pick-and-place remote guiding tasks. We found that the remote experts prefer to learn the local physical layout and search for the targets with a global perspective from the 3D free view. The results also showed that the experts chose to use the 360° live view with independent view control rather than the 2D first-person view with high-resolution to control the task procedures and check the local worker’s actions. Our study informs the viewpoint interface design for a MR remote collaboration system in various guiding scenarios.},

abstract = {Recently, the data management model using personal data store (PDS), which is a mechanism for users to store and manage their personal data, has been discussed in response to stricter privacy protection worldwide. In this regard, we developed a data-driven personalization method for broadcasting services. Various personal data, such as program viewing history and Internet service usage history, are stored centrally in the PDS on the user's side. This personal data can be utilized under user control when using various services allowing cross-industry service collaboration while maintaining a high level of transparency to the user. This enables users to use broadcasting service more widely and conveniently by linking it with various Internet services. In this study, we developed a prototype system that implements end-to-end components from acquisition to utilization of broadcast program viewing history. The system consists of a set of functions that acquires viewing history from broadcast and Internet streaming, stores it on PDS, and uses it in applications. The PDS implementation utilizes open-source software based on web standards to facilitate data linkage with a variety of Internet services. As an effective example for system evaluation, we designed and prototyped on-demand video viewing services in which separate applications of different service providers are linked via the PDS.},

To ensure that end-users achieve the intended type of collaboration, systematic testing can be an effective means. However, manually creating effective test cases is cumbersome and error prone as the amount of end-users interactions to test grows exponentially with the number of involved end-users and roles.In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatic test case generation via modeling user collaborations as synchronized, non-deterministic Finite State Machines. As our preliminary evaluation shows, such collaboration models are effective and efficient: compared to collaboration-unaware alternatives, we generated test cases which achieve higher code coverage and trigger more errors, up to 10X faster.},

abstract = {Application-centric computing dominates human-computer interactions, yet the concept of an application is ambiguous and the impact of its ubiquity underexplored. We unpack "the application" through the lens of non-standard knowledge work: freelance, self-employed, and fixed-term contract workers who create knowledge in collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders on a per-project basis. Based on interviews with fourteen participants we describe how: i) their economic value is intertwined with data and skills related to specific applications; ii) their access to this value is systematically jeopardised in collaboration due to the different application practices, preferences, and proficiencies of other stakeholders; and iii) they mitigate the costs of this compromise through cross-application collaboration strategies. We trace these experiences to common characteristics of applications, such as update processes, interface symmetries, application-document relationships, and operating system and hardware dependencies. By empirically and analytically focusing on "the application", we reveal the implications of the current application-centric computing paradigm and discuss how variations within this model create qualitatively different human-computer interactions.},

This paper presents an approach to distributed interfaces as technology supporting social interaction in a non-work environment. It consists of a collaborative music system, which in addition to benefit from distributed music storage also distributes playback control onto several mobile devices and provides output through a common situated display. The system has been tested in three different real-life contexts in order to explore the interaction space of non-work multi-device, multi-user environments.},

abstract = {In collaborative situations, eye gaze is a critical element of behavior which supports and fulfills many activities and roles. In current computer-supported collaboration systems, eye gaze is poorly supported. Even in a state-of-the-art video conferencing system such as the access grid, although one can see the face of the user, much of the communicative power of eye gaze is lost. This article gives an overview of some preliminary work that looks towards integrating eye gaze into an immersive collaborative virtual environment and assessing the impact that this would have on interaction between the users of such a system. Three experiments were conducted to assess the efficacy of eye gaze within immersive virtual environments. In each experiment, subjects observed on a large screen the eye-gaze behavior of an avatar. The eye-gaze behavior of that avatar had previously been recorded from a user with the use of a head-mounted eye tracker. The first experiment was conducted to assess the difference between users' abilities to judge what objects an avatar is looking at with only head gaze being viewed and also with eye- and head-gaze data being displayed. The results from the experiment show that eye gaze is of vital importance to the subjects, correctly identifying what a person is looking at in an immersive virtual environment. The second experiment examined whether a monocular or binocular eye-tracker would be required. This was examined by testing subjects' ability to identify where an avatar was looking from their eye direction alone, or by eye direction combined with convergence. This experiment showed that convergence had a significant impact on the subjects' ability to identify where the avatar was looking. The final experiment looked at the effects of stereo and mono-viewing of the scene, with the subjects being asked to identify where the avatar was looking. This experiment showed that there was no difference in the subjects' ability to detect where the avatar was gazing. This is followed by a description of how the eye-tracking system has been integrated into an immersive collaborative virtual environment and some preliminary results from the use of such a system.},

abstract = {Recently, web based cross reality (XR) concept embracing virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) technology has emerged, but user interaction devices for collaborative work supported in web environments are limited. The Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN) in the traditional VR environment provides a device-independent and network transparent interface. To promote the development of web based XR applications, a common method is required to support a collaborative interaction space in VR, AR, and MR contexts according to the user environment and various interaction devices that can be used without limitation of XR content in web based XR environments as well. In this paper, we propose a webizing method for a collaborative interaction space that provides user authentication and manages user sessions in XR environments. In addition, the webizing method supports human interface devices and related events via an interaction adaptor that delivers events based on user session and converts event messages according to XR content types such as VRPN messages, X3D sensor data, and HTML DOM events to deal with interaction events.},

abstract = {A book recommender system is very useful for a digital library. Good book recommender systems can effectively help users find interesting and relevant books from the massive resources, by providing individual recommendation book list for each end-user. By now, a variety of collaborative filtering algorithms have been invented, which are the cores of most recommender systems. However, because of the explosion of information, especially in the Internet, the improvement of the efficiency of the collaborative filting (CF) algorithm becomes more and more important. In this paper, we first propose a parallel Top-N recommendation algorithm in CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) which combines the collaborative filtering and trust-based approach to deal with the cold-start user problem. Then based on this algorithm, we present a parallel book recommender system on a GPU (Graphics Processor unit) for CADAL digital library platform. Our experimental results show our algorithm is very efficient to process the large-scale datasets with good accuracy, and we report the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation performance.},

A fundamental barrier to such collaborations is the ability to refer to parts of the geometry (such as a specific face) robustly under geometric and/or topological changes to the model. Persistent referencing schemes are a fundamental aspect of most CAD tools, but models that are shared across systems cannot generally make use of these internal referencing mechanisms, creating a challenge for collaboration. In this work, we address this issue by developing a novel learning-based algorithm that can automatically find correspondences between two CAD models using the standard representation used for sharing models across CAD systems: the Boundary-Representation (B-rep). Because our method works directly on B-reps it can be generalized across different CAD applications enabling collaboration.},

abstract = {To enable the usage of service robots in a smart environment we have developed a decoupled three-layered architecture. The architecture is separated into three parts: hardware abstraction layer, domain level as well as control and collaboration layer. The hardware abstraction layer considers hardware drivers and elementary functions, like inverse kinematics for manipulators. The domain level wraps the hardware in autonomous agents. They offer features in the system, can communicate with each other and are responsible for local task planning. The third layer enables the global task planning and allows the system to solve more complex tasks that are shared between single agents. The layer is based on an ontology to reduce the effort of implementing and incorporating new agents. Purpose of this work is to build a slim, reliable and effective architecture, which is able to work with heterogeneous robot and smart-home hardware. Furthermore, it should be able to solve dynamically tasks with the available resources.},

abstract = {Collaboration is an essential component of many project-based learning environments; however, verbal interactions within groups can be ineffective. Extending previous research, this study investigated verbal interactions within teams of high school students as they solved a prototypical design-task called the Earthquake task. Videotaped performance assessments of high and low performing teams were analyzed in depth. Teams were categorized as high and low performing using two different methods: (1) highest successful structure built and, (2) percentage of successful designs. Results suggest that teams engaged in three different patterns of verbal interactions: Accept-Build, Accept-Build-Discuss-Modify, and Discussion. High performing teams most often engaged in, and were most successful when, their verbal interactions followed the Accept-Build-Discus-Modify pathway. The instructional implications of these results for promoting productive group collaboration and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {Collaborative robots are quickly gaining momentum in real-world settings. This has motivated many new research questions in human-robot collaboration. In this paper, we address the questions of whether and when a robot should take initiative during joint human-robot task execution. We develop a system capable of autonomously tracking and performing table-top object manipulation tasks with humans and we implement three different initiative models to trigger robot actions. Human initiated help gives control of robot action timing to the user; robot-initiated reactive help triggers robot assistance when it detects that the user needs help; and robot-initiated proactive help makes the robot help whenever it can. We performed a user study (N=18) to compare these trigger mechanisms in terms of task performance, usage characteristics, and subjective preference. We found that people collaborate best with a proactive robot, yielding better team fluency and high subjective ratings. However, they prefer having control of when the robot should help, rather than working with a reactive robot that only helps when it is needed.},

abstract = {Human action is built by actively and simultaneously combining materials with intrinsically different properties into situated contextual configurations where they can mutually elaborate each other to create a whole that is both different from, and greater than, any of its constitutive parts. These resources include many different kinds of lexical and syntactic structures, prosody, gesture, embodied participation frameworks, sequential organization, and different kinds of materials in the environment, including tools created by others that structure local perception. The simultaneous use of different kinds of resources to build single actions has a number of consequences. First, different actors can contribute different kinds of materials that are implicated in the construction of a single action. For example embodied visual displays by hearers operate simultaneously on emerging talk by a speaker so that both the utterance and the turn have intrinsic organization that is both multi-party and multimodal. Someone with aphasia who is unable to produce lexical and syntactic structure can nonetheless contribute crucial prosodic and sequential materials to a local action, while appropriating the lexical contributions of others, and thus become a powerful speaker in conversation, despite catastrophically impoverished language. One effect of this simultaneous, distributed heterogeneity is that frequently the organization of action cannot be easily equated with the activities of single individuals, such as the person speaking at the moment, or with phenomena within a single medium such as talk. Second, subsequent action is frequently built through systematic transformations of the different kinds of materials provided by a prior action. In this process some elements of the prior contextual configuration, such as the encompassing participation framework, may remain unchanged, while others undergo significant modification. A punctual perspective on action, in which separate actions discretely follow one another, thus becomes more complex when action is seen to emerge within an unfolding mosaic of disparate materials and time frames which make possible not only systematic change, but also more enduring frameworks that provide crucial continuity. Third, the distributed, compositional structure of action provides a framework for developing the skills of newcomers within structured collaborative action. Fourth, human tools differ from the tools of other animals in that, like actions in talk, they are built by combining unlike materials into a whole not found in any of the individual parts (for example using a stone, a piece of wood and leather thongs to make an ax). This same combinatorial heterogeneity sits at the heart of human action in interaction, including language use. It creates within the unfolding organization of situated activity itself the distinctive forms of transformative collaborative action in the world, including socially organized perceptual and cognitive structures and the mutual alignment of bodies to each other, which constitutes us as humans.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore shared collocated interactions with mobile phones. We introduce a phone-based application that allows a small group of collocated people to share photos using the metaphor of passing paper photos around. The prototype encourages people to share their devices and use them interchangeably while discussing photos face-to-face. The prototype supports ad-hoc photo sharing in different contexts by taking into account the spatial arrangement of users around a table, measured with sensors embedded in their mobile phones. Our evaluations show that people are willing to share and connect their mobile phones to engage in collaborative interactions. Participants were able to easily share their collections of photos using our proposed interaction techniques.},

abstract = {In recent years the popularity of music and rhythm-based games has experienced tremendous growth. However almost all of these games require custom hardware to be used as input devices, and these devices control only one or two similar instruments. In this paper we describe One Man Band, a prototype video game for musical expression that uses novel 3D spatial interaction techniques using accelerometer-based motion controllers. One Man Band provides users with 3D gestural interfaces to control both the timing and sound of the music played, with both single and collaborative player modes. We further investigate the ability to detect different musical gestures without explicit selection of mode, giving the user the ability to seamlessly transition between instrument types with a single input device. A formal user study is then presented comparing the musical interface of One Man Band to that of Nintendo's Wii Music. Our results indicate that users generally preferred the interface of One Man Band over that of Wii Music. We also found that users desire to express their own ideas and have explicit control of the melodies created in music-based video games.},

abstract = {Due to the rapid development of ocean observation technology, the volume of ocean data is increasing exponentially. To better utilize these data, more and more computational methods have been applied to exploring, sharing, and processing such data. Although great efforts have been made, there is an urgent need for a single platform containing a set of visualization components for every kind of ocean data. This paper presents a distributed, scalable and service-oriented visualization platform. The development of the platform is based on a common data model, by which ocean data with different spatial and temporal distribution can be organized and accessed in a uniform fashion, which sets a solid foundation for designing and implementing all kinds of visualization components and facilitates collaborative oceanographic research. The platform is run in China Ocean Observation System (COOS), and enables easy and convenient development of all kinds of visualization components for professionals and the general public and greatly advances ocean data sharing and scientific research collaboration.},

abstract = {Nowadays, researches on mixed reality (MR) have made a lot of exploration in the aspects of user experience, hardware devices, interaction technologies, application systems, etc. However, more research is still needed to explore how to improve the experience in the shared MR Environment and design appropriate collaborative interaction models. The traditional VR handle can realize tool simulation and 3D interaction, while smartphones can realize 2D interactions such as fast 2D gestures, text input and handwriting. Using the mobile phone as the handle of the MR headset can realize the complementary advantages of the two. In this study, we design a cross-device collaborative system sharing a hybrid reality environment. In the MR Environment, the smartphone will realize the functions of the controller for remote selection and manipulation of objects, and its advantages in 2D interaction can be well applied to some special tasks. We design the user interface with three levels of immersion: high, medium and low. High immersion: We provide a hybrid user interface combining a HoloLens2 and a smartphone. Medium immersion: We provide a 3D user interface represented by HoloLens2. Low immersion: We provide a multi-touch user interface represented by tablet. User studies show that the hybrid user interfaces can bring users satisfactory immersion and interactive experience, but it also needs to design accurate and efficient input methods according to the interactive tasks.},

abstract = {Traditional offline optimization frameworks rely on representative hardware, software, and inputs to compare different optimizations on. With application-specific optimization for mobile systems though, the idea of a representative testbench is unrealistic while creating offline inputs is non-trivial. Online approaches partially overcome these problems but they might expose users to suboptimal or even erroneous code. Therefore, our mobile code is poorly optimized, resulting in wasted performance and energy and user frustration.In this article, we introduce a novel compiler optimization approach designed for mobile applications. It requires no developer effort, it tunes applications for the user’s device and usage patterns, and it has no negative impact on the user experience. It is based on a lightweight capture and replay mechanism. Our previous work&nbsp;[46] captures the state accessed by any targeted code region during its online stage. By repurposing existing OS capabilities, it keeps the overhead low. In its offline stage, it replays the code region but under different optimization decisions to enable sound comparisons of different optimizations under realistic conditions. In this article, we propose a technique that further decreases the storage sizes without any additional overhead. It captures only the intersection of reachable objects and accessed heap pages. We compare this with another new approach that has minimal runtime overheads at the cost of higher capture sizes. Coupled with a search heuristic for the compiler optimization space, our capture and replay mechanism allows us to discover optimization decisions that improve performance without testing these decisions directly on the user. Finally, with crowd-sourcing we split this offline evaluation effort between several users, allowing us to discover better code in less time.We implemented a prototype system in Android based on LLVM combined with a genetic search engine and a crowd-sourcing architecture. We evaluated it on both benchmarks and real Android applications. Online captures are infrequent and introduce ~5 ms or 15 ms on average, depending on the approach used. For this negligible effect on user experience, we achieve speedups of 44%&nbsp; on average over the Android compiler and 35% over LLVM -O3. Our collaborative search is just 5% short of that speedup, which is impressive given the acceleration gains. The user with the highest workload concluded the search 7 ( times )  faster.},

abstract = {Instructional Designers who occupy a centralized position within the university structure face unique challenges when collaborating across discipline-specific communities of practice. In addition to wide diversity in subject matter-specific technological needs, different departments carry their own cultural values surrounding technology-enhanced instruction, as well as unique histories of successes and failures with technological systems used to support teaching and learning. In addition, schools and colleges within the same university, when decentralized, present challenges to interdisciplinary collaborations and communications across departments. Among teams of Instructional Designers specifically, the shifting nature of focus, working groups, vendors, versions, and interfaces, as well as changes in University leadership can compound issues of planning, organizing, implementing, and tracking technological work with faculty and departments longitudinally.  This paper offers a case study of the adoption and use of a cloud-based software tool used in pursuit of greater cohesiveness, support, collaboration, and partnering across a large campus infrastructure. It draws on organizational literature focusing on collaborative software in the workplace, as well as industry accepted best practices in customer relationship management.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a promising technology to build machine learning models in a decentralized, privacy-preserving fashion. Indeed, FL enables local training on user devices, avoiding user data to be transferred to centralized servers, and can be enhanced with differential privacy mechanisms. Although FL has been recently deployed in real systems, the possibility of collaborative modeling across different 3rd-party applications has not yet been explored. In this paper, we tackle this problem and present Federated Learning as a Service (FLaaS), a system enabling different scenarios of 3rd-party application collaborative model building and addressing the consequent challenges of permission and privacy management, usability, and hierarchical model training. FLaaS can be deployed in different operational environments. As a proof of concept, we implement it on a mobile phone setting and discuss practical implications of results on simulated and real devices with respect to on-device training CPU cost, memory footprint and power consumed per FL model round. Therefore, we demonstrate FLaaS's feasibility in building unique or joint FL models across applications for image object detection in a few hours, across 100 devices.},

Novel contributions that introduce paradigms addressing the need for process execution flexibility form an alternative to traditional workflow management approaches and are mostly subsumed under the concept of adaptive case management (ACM). However, many of these approaches omit mining any kind of knowledge about such processes. This is because there is a gap between process mining, which works well for structured processes, and ACM, which mainly focuses on information system support for task management and collaboration using heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, we strive to bridge this gap by introducing a method for mining knowledge-intensive processes. It is part of agenda-driven case management, an ACM approach that follows the idea of mining common execution patterns while a case manager handles a flexible agenda.},

In practical applications, many hybrid heterogeneous computer systems based on CPU and GPU show good performance. However, due to various reasons, heterogeneous computing still faces many problems. The most prominent problem is the difficulty of program development, especially when it is extended to the cluster scale level. These problems are mainly reflected in scalability, load balancing, and adaptability.

abstract = {Due to the fast advancement of technology, cybercrime is also increasing in frequency and complexity. Since a variety of attacks evolves regularly with complex patterns and varied signatures the task of securing cyberspace becomes more and more difficult and challenging. To minimize the impact of cybercrime through early detection of intrusions, network activity in terms of network traffic, is monitored in real-time thus accumulating huge data which is sometimes erroneous. In order to create efficient security algorithms for attack detection, it is crucial to combine the principles of cybersecurity with data analytics. Known attacks are detected by the signature-based intrusion detection systems but the success of these systems heavily depends on feature engineering performed on the training data used to create attack signatures. In the context of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) most of the standard datasets have predominantly numeric data with a few categorical features and hence calls for the exploration of appropriate methods for handling the few categorical features to develop a successful intrusion detection system. Intruders aim to create zero-day attacks, which are entirely unheard-of, to avoid being discovered. The standard machine learning based intrusion detection systems won't initially catch zero-day assaults since there is a dearth of labelled data. Since, zero-day attacks are unknown attacks with ever-volving nature, it is very difficult to identify them, and also it is highly desirable to stop them. Zero-day attacks are handled in two different scenarios; the first scenario wherein minimal attack information is shared among the nodes of an Intrusion Detection Network (IDN) and the second scenario wherein there is no labeled information at all related to the zero-day attack.Three security-related concerns are the focus of this research project: (i)&nbsp;efficient detection of existing attacks, (ii) early detection of novel attacks, and (iii) detection of zero-day attacks. The research suggests using a transfer learning strategy in order to counter zero-day assaults. To handle the first case, inductive transfer learning is necessary, but transductive transfer learning is needed to provide a framework for intrusion detection in the second scenario. In the context of IDN, a transfer learning framework for the early identification of new assaults. The proposed transfer learning framework leverages the few labeled examples of a new attack shared among the collaborative nodes of an IDN for the detection of new attacks. Supervised Manifold Alignment methodology for Domain Unification is applied to circumvent the problem of heterogeneous feature spaces maintained by the different nodes of the IDN in the process of collaborative learning. Since, most of them are variants of existing attacks whose signatures are already recognized, in this thesis authors proposes a Deep transductive transfer learning framework that aims to apply transfer learning as it can transfer the knowledge that is acquired while learning signatures of known attacks for detecting of zero-day attacks. Unsupervised Manifold Alignment methodology for Domain Unification is proposed to transfer knowledge from source domain through cluster correspondence.},

In 2016, we reported the success of applying mobile application development to biomedical education for creating a mobile health system for the students. To extend this success, we spent one year designing and teaching a new research-oriented interdisciplinary EPIC course for guiding undergraduate students to conduct research projects in biomedical field. In this talk, I will summarize our learning from this process, including (1) Why is it more difficult to teach a research-oriented EPIC course than a regular course for undergraduate students from different majors? (2) How to conquer some difficulties found in this process? (3) How to design suitable lectures and laboratory assignments to facilitate research collaboration?

This Reconfigurable Tangible Device (RTD) provides points of manipulation rigidly linked together. The shape of the RTD can be reconfigured at any time as its arms can be compressed or stretched by users at will. Due to its simple shape the Reconfigurable Tangible Device can be attached to any 3D virtual object. Then, it can fully define the motion of the virtual object in 6 Degrees of Freedom. Two examples of Reconfigurable Tangible Device were developed: one with three points of manipulation (a reconfigurable triangle) and one with four points. We illustrate how these two simple devices can match many different shapes of 3D objects, and in different contexts. Preliminary testing was conducted with the RTD based on three points of manipulation involving a collaborative manipulation task in virtual reality. It produced better subjective appreciation for the RTD compared to more classical 3D collaborative techniques.},

abstract = {One focus of multi-agent systems research is the notion that complex outcomes or behaviours may be arrived at through the interaction of agents. However, it is still an open question as to how agents in a complex system form coalitions or modules, and how these coalitions self-organize into hierarchies. In this paper, we begin to address this question by investigating agent collaboration in the context of a high-level pattern recognition task. We propose a novel market-based communication protocol, which governs the aggregate behaviour of individual agents and subsequent emergent properties of the system. Based on the Contract Net Protocol, individual agents bid to join coalitions (or solutions to a given problem). An important contribution of this study is the analysis of the role heterogeneous agents play in the formation of coalitions. Using a simple model, we show that by promoting diversity within the agent population it is possible to avoid deadlock or "tie" conditions, which otherwise have to be solved arbitrarily by the deadlocked agents.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the number of computer systems using AI has increased dramatically. To date, indeed, AI is present in almost all the aspects of the human everyday life. This resulted in the attempt of scholars in Computer Science to endow machines with human-like socio-cognitive skills and/or human-like embodiment to try to improve interactions. Such an approach, however, highlights several crucial issues related to the substantial differences between fine-grained human skills and what machines can do and learn. So, although being expensive and sophisticated tools, machines tend to be “idiots savants”. Hybrid Intelligence (HI) is aimed to tackle this issue by proposing, as Akata and colleagues say, “systems that operate as mixed teams, where humans and machines cooperate synergistically, proactively, and purposefully to achieve shared goals”. To our knowledge, however, HI is at a very early exploratory stage, and few concrete solutions to deal with it exist. In this position paper we introduce and briefly describe “Middle-Earth”, a conceptual and experimental ground to study HI. Moreover, we present a first prototype of a software platform based on immersive VR environments, on which we plan to carry out in the future the first pioneering experiments on teams of humans and/or AI-driven agents getting together in Middle Earth to perform collaborative tasks.},

abstract = {Through a multitude of different devices, such as phones, tablets, desktop systems etc., we are able to exchange data across the world, independently of location, time and the device used. Almost by default applications are extended with networking capabilities, either deployed locally on the client device and connecting to a server or, as the trend is now, fully hosted on the Internet (servers) as a service (cloud services). However many 3D applications are still restricted to a single platform, as it is costly in terms of developing, maintaining, adapting and providing support for multiple platforms (software as well for hardware dependencies). Therefore applications that we see now available on a variety of devices are either single-platform, single-user, non-real-time collaborative or graphically not demanding. By using an adaptive remote rendering approach it is feasible to take advantage of these new devices and provide means for old and new 3D oriented applications to be used in collaborative environments. In this paper, we look at the conversion of a single user 3D application into a multi-user service. Analyse the requirements needed for adapting the software for being integrated into the "Herd framework". Offering remote rendering to end devices, a single instance accessible to multiple users and in order to optimize each instance of the application for different devices the user interface representation is handled in a dynamically using a device profile, as well for handling different input techniques.},

abstract = {This paper describes patient safety development in a bilateral health care project using activity theory. A regional Swedish health care provider engages in several international collaborations to exchange knowledge and insights with other organizations. The heath care provider has had a collaboration focused on patient safety with a Kenyan health care provider since 2015. The purpose of this study was to explore how the how patient safety development in a low and middle-income country healthcare system was supported, described as an activity system. Data was collected by conducting interviews with six participants involved in the patient safety collaboration, by visiting the Kenyan setting, and through analysis of available and relevant policy documents. Patient safety was analyzed using the activity system concepts activity, subject, objective, object, mediating artefacts, rules and regulations, community, and division of labor. The results showed that several factors are involved in patient safety development, both within an organization and in supporting the development. Health care organizations should strive for commitment to patient safety at all levels of the organization, striving for a safety culture where staff members are comfortable reporting errors. The management should pursue patient safety questions and put aside resources for patient safety development. As the Swedish and Kenyan health care providers are different in many aspects, it's important to be attentive to and understanding of differences triggered by available resources, cultural norms, rules, and organizational structures. Identified factors create opportunities for project participants to be inspired and question current methods and norms in respective organization, which can result in improvements. It is important to stress that both partners learn from the collaboration},

abstract = {There are significant regional inequities in health resources around the world. It has become one of the most focused topics to improve health services for data-scarce hospitals and promote health equity through knowledge sharing among medical institutions. Because electronic medical records (EMRs) contain sensitive personal information, privacy protection is unavoidable and essential for multi-hospital collaboration. In this paper, for a common disease in ICU patients, sepsis, we propose a novel cross-center collaborative learning framework guided by medical knowledge, SofaNet, to achieve early recognition of this disease. The Sepsis-3 guideline, published in 2016, defines that sepsis can be diagnosed by satisfying both suspicion of infection and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) greater than or equal to 2. Based on this knowledge, SofaNet adopts a multi-channel GRU structure to predict SOFA values of different systems, which can be seen as an auxiliary task to generate better health status representations for sepsis recognition. Moreover, we only achieve feature distribution alignment in the hidden space during cross-center collaborative learning, which ensures secure and compliant knowledge transfer without raw data exchange. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SofaNet can benefit early sepsis recognition when hospitals only have limited EMRs.},

abstract = {The digital game industry has recently adopted recommendation systems to provide suitable game and content choices to players. Recommendations in digital games have several unique applications and challenges compared to other well known recommendation system such as those for movies and books. Designers must adopt different architectures and algorithms to overcome these challenges. In this talk, we describe the game recommendation system at Electronic Arts. It leverages heterogeneous player data across many games to provide intelligent recommendations. We discuss three example applications: recommending games for purchase, suitable game map, and game difficulty.Like the movie and book recommendation problem, one application is to recommend the next favorite games for a player. Digital games fall into a wide range of genres such as first player shooting (FPS), sports, and role-playing games (RPG). Games within the same genre however tend to be unique and creative. While the recommendation item space is smaller, the recommendation system should also manage different types of contents such as games and extra downloadable contents to play, editorial videos and tutorials to watch.The second application provides the game mode and map recommendations within a game to improve player experience. Many online digital games, especially FPS and sports games, contain different maps and game modes to provide diverse gameplay experience. Different maps and game modes often require different skill levels, strategies, or cooperation from players, and the maps and game modes are often played repeatedly. Therefore, recommending the most suitable map and game mode is important from smooth onboarding experience to retain players who are likely to churn. In the map and game mode recommendation application, the algorithms need to evaluate both the short-term actions as well as long term effects of playing different maps and game modes to optimize player's engagement.In addition, we also use the same recommendation system to adjust in-game configurations such as difficulty. Players have a wide variety of experiences, skills, learning rates, and playing styles, and will react differently to the same difficulty setting. Second, even for an individual player, one's difficulty preference may also change over time. For example, in a level progression game, a player who loses the first several attempts to one level might feel much less frustrated compared to losing after tens of unsuccessful trials. The difficulty recommendation provides suggestions and adjustments on game configuration based on the player's previous gameplay experience to maximize the engagement. For online multiplayer games, recommending partners and opponents in matchmaking is also an effective way to improve player experience.We developed one flexible recommendation system to satisfy the need of different applications and that executes data-driven algorithms such collaborative filtering and multi-armed bandit. The centralized system leverages entire player and game data for all recommendation applications in digital games, supports unified roll-out and update, and at the same time measures the performance together via A/B testing experiments. Moreover, the one system strategy is easy to generate consistent recommendations across multiple games and platforms. We tested these recommendation applications in EA website and games, an observed significant improvements in click-through-rate and engagement.},

In this context, the importance of Semantic Web data as a premier knowledge source is rapidly increasing. But we are still far from having accurate natural language interfaces that allow handling complex information needs in a user-centric and highly performant manner. The development of such interfaces requires collaboration of a range of different fields, including natural language processing, information extraction, knowledge base construction and population, reasoning, and question answering.

abstract = {IoT Device Management (DM) refers to the remote administration of customer devices. In practice, DM is ensured by multiple actors such as operators or device manufacturers, each operating independently via their DM solution. These siloed DM solutions are limited in addressing IoT threats related to device dependencies, such as cascading failures, as these threats spread across devices managed by different DM actors, and their mitigation can no longer be performed without collaborative DM efforts. The first step toward collaborative mitigation of these threats is the identification of threatening dependency topology. However, this task is challenging, requiring the inference of dependencies from the data held by different actors. In this work, we propose a collaborative framework that infers the threatening topology of dependencies by accessing and aggregating data from legacy DM solutions. It combines the assets of Semantic Web standards and Digital Twin technology to capture on-demand the topology of dependencies, and it is designed to be used in business applications such as customer care to enhance customer Quality of Experience. We integrate our solution within the in-use Orange's Digital Twin platform Thing in the future and demonstrate its effectiveness by automatically inferring threatening dependencies in the two settings: a simulated smart home scenario managed by ground-truth DM solutions, such as Orange's implementation of the USP Controller and Samsung's SmartThings Platform, and a realistic smart home called DOMUS testbed.},

abstract = {Federated recommendation systems employ federated learning techniques to safeguard user privacy by transmitting model parameters instead of raw user data between user devices and the central server. Nevertheless, the current federated recommender system faces three significant challenges: (1) data heterogeneity: the heterogeneity of users’ attributes and local data necessitates the acquisition of personalized models to improve the performance of federated recommendation; (2) model performance degradation: the privacy-preserving protocol design in the federated recommendation, such as pseudo item labeling and differential privacy, would deteriorate the model performance; (3) communication bottleneck: the standard federated recommendation algorithm can have a high communication overhead. Previous studies have attempted to address these issues, but none have been able to solve them simultaneously.In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PerFedRec++, to enhance the personalized federated recommendation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we utilize the privacy-preserving mechanism of federated recommender systems to generate two augmented graph views, which are used as contrastive tasks in self-supervised graph learning to pre-train the model. Pre-training enhances the performance of federated models by improving the uniformity of representation learning. Also, by providing a better initial state for federated training, pre-training makes the overall training converge faster, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden. We then construct a collaborative graph to learn the client representation through a federated graph neural network. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Each user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the cluster-level federated model, and its own fine-tuned local model. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods.},

This paper presents the results of a set of semi-structured interviews of N=81, 5 to 8 years old children who previously interacted in pairs with a robot in the context of a problem-solving task. We manipulated two different factors of the robot behaviour: cognitive reliability in logic game movements (optimal vs sub-optimal) and expressivity in the communication (expressive vs neutral) and we assigned the children in one of the four conditions. At post-intervention interviews, we examined children's perceptions on the robot's attributions, collaboration and social role. Results indicate that a robot's cognitive reliability shapes the helping relationship between the children and the robot, while the robot's expressivity impacts children perception of the robot supportive ability and friendship. Finally, results also indicate that, even if children interact in pairs with the robot, their perceptions about it remain individual, although a good collective task-performance seems to empower children perception of the robot in terms of friendship and reliability.},

Social networks provide one means of visualizing existing and potential interaction in organizational settings. Groupware designers are using social networks to make systems more sensitive to social situations and guide users toward effective collaborations. Yet, the implications of embedding social networks in systems have not been systematically studied. This paper details an evaluation of two different social networks used in a system to recommend individuals for possible collaboration. The system matches people looking for expertise with individuals likely to have expertise. The effectiveness of social networks for matching individuals is evaluated and compared. One finding is that social networks embedded into systems do not match individuals' perceptions of their personal social network. This finding and others raise issues for the use of social networks in groupware. Based on the evaluation results, several design considerations are discussed.},

These systems support various content-orientation techniques to perform the simultaneous multi-user multi-touch interaction to access digital contents directly in a natural way. It is reported that existing techniques still have limited usability and user experience while performing the co-located collaborative tasks. However, it is still unclear what core usability dimensions need to be considered to assess the performance of these techniques using the different tabletop applications. Keeping in view this issue, this study aims to identify and select the core usability dimensions based on a literature review method. Based on the findings, a usability model is proposed that include three core dimensions i.e. effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The usability model also highlights the tabletop technologies, user characteristics, tasks, and contexts. It can be useful for interaction designers to empirically evaluate the content-orientation techniques using the different tabletop applications and to improve the collaboration design for the tabletop displays.},

abstract = {There has been much recent interest in the development of tools to foster remote collaboration and shared creative work. An open question is: what are the guidelines for this process? What are the key socio-technical preconditions required for a geographically distributed group to collaborate effectively on creative work, and are they different from the conditions of a decade or two ago? In an attempt to answer these questions, we conducted empirical studies of two seemingly very different online communities, both requiring effective collaboration and creative work: an international collaboration of astrophysicists studying supernovae to learn more about the expansion rate of the universe, and a group of children, ages 8-15, from different parts of the world, creating and sharing animated stories and video games on the Scratch online community developed at MIT. Both groups produced creative technical work jointly and were considered successful in their communities. Data included the analysis of thousands of lines from chat and comment logs over a period of several months, and interviews with community members. We discovered some surprising commonalities and some intriguing possibilities, and suggest guidelines for successful creative collaborations. Specifically, systems that support social creativity must facilitate sharing and play, and their design must consider the effects of repurposing, augmentation and behavior adaptation.},

abstract = {The 2018 ACM SIGGRAPH Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement in Digital Art is awarded to Monika Fleischmann, a research artist that has contributed to the field of interactive media art since the 1980s to the present day. She has pioneered the field of new media art, helping consolidate the shift that has of late transformed media into a research-led interactive media practice and a creative discipline; one that is able to engage in, analyze, and visualize digital media and their transformations in the context of shifting fields of cultural and educational contexts. These transformations have seen digital media turn into a refl exive and analytical arena for critical social and cultural thinking in her work. Her artistic goal is to shed light on the contradictory characteristics of digital media.Her work - realized since 1987 in partnership with architect and artist Wolfgang Strauss - ranges from fashion to digital architecture, interactive design, poetic and social sculptures that intuitively interact with people and environment to explore intersections between art, science, technology, and society. In 1987 she co-founded Art + Com, an interdisciplinary research institute for the convergence of analogue and digital culture in Berlin and the first research institute for digital media in Germany. This space has been instrumental to carry on collaborative projects at the intersection between art and computer science.In 1992, within the Scientific Visualization research group at the GMD (German National Research Center for Information Technology) in Sankt Augustin near Bonn, Germany, Fleischmann and Strauss (the first media artists in Germany to work in a research context in collaboration with computer scientists) began to develop ground breaking interactive media systems in both pure and applied contexts. Among the projects developed were the "responsive workbench," which today, along with the immersive virtual reality environment CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), is extensively deployed in visualization environments, as well as the interactive media installation "Liquid Views" which has been exhibited successfully across the world. The VR installation "Home of the Brain" (1989), in collaboration with Strauss, represents one of the pioneering VR interactive artworks and has earned them a Golden Nica of Prix Ars Electronica for interactive art. Their work has been exhibited and awarded internationally and is part of the collection of the ZKM, Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.In 1997, she founded the MARS Exploratory Media Lab, a research laboratory at the forefront of artistic and technical scientific research on digital media and one of the world's leading hubs for trans-disciplinary collaborations between artists, architects, designers, cultural scientists and computer scientists. As a research artist in a computer science environment, Fleischmann has benefited from and extended the research in this field and brought it across global networks by constructing netzspannung.org, one of the first media art archive and eTeaching platforms at Fraunhofer Research Society, Munich, Europe's largest application-oriented research organization.Her multidisciplinary background - fashion design, art and drama, computer graphics - has made her an expert in the world of art, computer science and media technology. Her artistic work deals with the change of identity and perception in a digital media culture.Beside the VR technology used in "Home of the Brain," Fleischmann has contributed to the development of sensitive surfaces for the promotion of joint content exploration. These began with the mixed reality installation about the fall of the Berlin Wall, "Berlin-Cyber City" (1988-1989), and continued with the interactive realtime morphing installation "Liquid Views" (1992-93) which originated in the first mirror touchscreen and further to a contactless interface - the PointScreen technology (patented in 2005) which was motivated by a search for alternatives to touching the screen. PointScreen is based on gesture control and the promotion of electric field sensing - with the energy of the body. Electric field sensing is a method to perceive the body in its essential condition.She uses the design of interfaces as a tool, as space and as a situation in the basis of communicative action and motivation, for her scientific exploration of mixed realities. ACM SIGGRAPH is honored to recognize Monika Fleischmann as an important pioneer for her research projects, based on interface design and new forms of communication.},

abstract = {Scientific publication retrieval/recommendation has been investigated in the past decade. However, to the best of our knowledge, few efforts have been made to help junior scholars and graduate students to understand and consume the essence of those scientific readings. This paper proposes a novel learning/reading environment, OER-based Collaborative PDF Reader (OCPR), that incorporates innovative scaffolding methods that can: 1. auto-characterize student emerging information need while reading a paper; and 2. enable students to readily access open educational resources (OER) based on their information need. By using metasearch methods, we pre-indexed 1,112,718 OERs, including presentation videos, slides, algorithm source code, or Wikipedia pages, for 41,378 STEM publications. Based on the computational information need, we use text mining and heterogeneous graph mining algorithms to recommend high quality OERs to help students better understand the scientific content in the paper. Evaluation results and exit surveys for an information retrieval course show that the OCPR system alone with the recommended OERs can effectively assist graduate students better understand the complex STEM publications. For instance, 78.42% of participants believe the OCPR system and recommended OERs can provide precise and useful information they need, while 78.43% of them believe the recommended OERs are close to exactly what they need when reading the paper. From OER ranking viewpoint, MRR, MAP and NDCG results prove that learning to rank and cold start solutions can efficiently integrate different text and graph ranking features.},

abstract = {The effects of team collaboration on performance have been explored in a variety of settings. Online games enable people with significantly different skills to cooperate and compete within a shared context. Players can affect teammates' performance either via direct communication or by influencing teammates' actions. Understanding such effects can help us provide insights into human behavior as well as make team recommendations. In this work, we aim at recommending teammates to each individual player for maximal skill growth. We study the effect of collaboration in online games using a large dataset from Dota 2, a popular Multiplayer Online Battle Arena game. To this aim, we construct an online co-play teammate network of players, whose links are weighted based on the gain in skill achieved due to team collaboration. We then use the performance network to devise a recommendation system based on a modified deep neural network autoencoder method.},

The first important result of the collaboration is the rise of an interdisciplinary team of cultural operators, which emerged from the confrontation of the different experiences acquired in each proper field of common research. As a consequence of such a confrontation process, the team was in need of new tools of expression, and communication. An ontology was defined as a new medium for communication between Computer Scientists and Archeologists. New media to record the results of the archaeological researches were introduced to disseminate knowledge to a large public in a novel, context adaptive way. The setting of these media are the base for the implementation of the working seed of the T.Arc.H.N.A System. The paper presents this open and participatory system where different actors cooperate to create and disseminate knowledge about cultural assets.},

The handling of such collaboration has different problems that lead to many research efforts. In this paper, we address the problem of Web service composition. Indeed, various heterogeneities can arise during the composition. The resolution of these heterogeneities, called mediation, is needed to achieve a service composition. In this paper, we propose a sound approach to formalize Web services composition mediation with the ADL (Architecture Description Language) ACME. To do so, we first model the meta model of composite service manager and mediation. Then we specify semi formal properties associated with this meta model using OCL (Object Constraint Language). Afterwards, we formalize the mediation protocol using Armani, which provides a powerful predicate language in order to ensure service execution reliability.},

abstract = {Can we improve P2P search by looking into our social network? In this paper, we argue that P2P networks built upon specific communities (e.g., scientific social networks) could achieve such a goal, by providing an implicit personalization to the output results set. Existing work in social networks investigating co-authorship relations has shown that scientific collaboration networks are scale-free. At the same time, P2P systems based on synthesized small-world networks have emerged, with a positive impact on search efficiency. We propose to use existing social collaboration graphs as foundation for the P2P topology instead of creating purely technological topologies. To get an insight into the relationship between scientific collaboration and co-authorship, we compared both for an existing collaboration network. Based on this analysis, we then generated a large P2P collaboration network derived from co-authorship data collections as basis for our experiments. The most prevalent search type in the scientific context is keyword search for relevant publications. We investigate different search strategies suitable in that context and show our initial experimental results.},

abstract = {As data privacy and security attract increasing attention, Federated Recommender System (FRS) offers a solution that strikes a balance between providing high-quality recommendations and preserving user privacy. However, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in FRS, commonly observed due to personalized decision-making patterns, can pose challenges. To address this issue and maximize the benefit of collaborative filtering (CF) in FRS, it is intuitive to consider clustering clients (users) as well as items into different groups and learning group-specific models. Existing methods either resort to client clustering via user representations-risking privacy leakage, or employ classical clustering strategies on item embeddings or gradients, which we found are plagued by the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we delve into the inefficiencies of the K-Means method in client grouping, attributing failures due to the high dimensionality as well as data sparsity occurring in FRS, and propose CoFedRec, a novel Co-clustering Federated Recommendation mechanism, to address clients heterogeneity and enhance the collaborative filtering within the federated framework. Specifically, the server initially formulates an item membership from the client-provided item networks. Subsequently, clients are grouped regarding a specific item category picked from the item membership during each communication round, resulting in an intelligently aggregated group model. Meanwhile, to comprehensively capture the global inter-relationships among items, we incorporate an additional supervised contrastive learning term based on the server-side generated item membership into the local training phase for each client. Extensive experiments on four datasets are provided, which verify the effectiveness of the proposed CoFedRec.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging has become a very popular way to share, annotate, and discover online resources in Web 2.0. Yet as the number of resources in Collaborative tagging system grows over time, sifting through the large amounts of resources and finding the right resources to recommend to the right user is becoming a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topic-based personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.},

However, few existing studies have focused on news recommendations depending on the rates of news-category interests. In this paper, we present a personalized news-recommendation system that builds profiles of users' news-category interests, determines the number of news articles to be recommended for each news category in proportion to news-category interests and ranks news articles according to the user's news interests. In order to find the news categories that are interesting to read, the smart device collects the web pages viewed by the user and classifies the contents. We use machine learning techniques in order to classify web pages into different categories, and the results of our experimentation show that Naive Bayes achieved the highest F-measure. The news preference is automatically calculated by the news reading time and the length of the news text. News articles with high preference generated by the collaborative filtering technique are recommended based on the rate of each category. The recommendation system we have implemented is based on collaborative filtering using Mahout Recommender API on Hadoop. Through user testing, we also assess whether the proposed system is useful.},

Engineering artifacts stored in model repositories are developed in either offline (checkout-modify-commit) or online (GoogleDoc-style) scenarios. Complex systems frequently integrate models and components developed by different teams, vendors and suppliers. Thus confidentiality and integrity of design artifacts need to be protected by access control policies.We propose a technique for secure collaborative modeling where (1) fine-grained access control for models can be defined by model queries, and (2) such access control policies are strictly enforced by bidirectional model transformations. Each collaborator obtains a filtered local copy of the model containing only those model elements which they are allowed to read; write access control policies are checked on the server upon submitting model changes. We illustrate the approach and carry out an initial scalability assessment using a case study of the MONDO EU project.},

For different reasons, e.g., legislation, data owners need to control who has access to and how their data are analyzed. The analysis of data is performed in statistical software, which is usually called on top of a data management system, e.g., a database management system (DBMS). Therefore access to data is controlled by the DBMS, while statistical analyses are usually controlled by another system. To improve security we propose a novel architecture for executing statistical analysis on data stored in a DBMS. In the proposed architecture the statistical software is called from a DBMS. The architecture allows control of both data retrieval and statistical data analysis from one system, i.e., DBMS. We implemented a prototype for executing analysis programs by calling statistical software SAS from a relational DBMS IBM DB2 over data stored in DB2 database. This paper describes the proposed architecture and the implemented prototype.},

abstract = {The growing adoption of IT infrastructures determined a high heterogeneity of software systems. As matter of fact, the software is prone to vulnerabilities and cybersecurity problems, which are challenging to manage during the software lifecycle. The situation is further compounded by the growing demand for rapid application development and the widespread diffusion of Agile methodologies and the DevOps culture. This process promotes collaboration within and between the different groups involved in software development. In recent years there has been a spread of new or adapted security-oriented methodologies providing different approaches to identify security problems in the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC), thus reducing the costs for the security assessment. SecDevOps is just an example of the integration and promotion of security aspects in DevOps organizations. While these methodologies help to produce more reliable software, on other hand they are difficult to integrate into standard or customized SDLC, or with design evaluation and risk management methodologies. This work analyzes the state of the art and aims at identifying the main activities in a Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC), by proposing a new secure software development lifecycle meta-model (MetaSEnD). MetaSEnD has also been applied in a continuous integration pipeline of a sample microservices application.},

abstract = {With the increase of resource-sharing web sites such as YouTube1 and Flickr2, personalized search becomes more important and challenging, as users demand higher retrieval quality. To achieve this goal, personalized search needs to take users' personalized profiles and information needs into consideration. Collaborative tagging (also known as folksonomy [11]) systems allow users to annotate resources with their own tags, which provide a simple but powerful way for organizing, retrieving and sharing different types of social resources. In this paper, we examine the limitations of previous tag-based personalized search. To handle these limitations, we propose a new method to model user profiles and resource profiles in a collaborative tagging environment. A novel search method using such users' and resources' profiles is proposed to facilitate the desired personalization in resource search. We implement a prototype system named as FMRS. Experiments using FMRS data set and MovieLens data set show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods.},

abstract = {We designed a communication system for law enforcement officers to use when conducting explosive detection searches with multiple agencies. Dogs trained in explosive detection work alongside human handlers to form a K9 team, which are an integral part of these searches. Officers in K9 teams have a strong bond and communication with these dogs, but noisy locations, long distances, and crowded spaces present challenges. In addition, other officers assigned as backup often lack the experience to read the cues from the canine, which hinders the speed and effectiveness of the team. Coordinating a search with teams from different municipalities presents challenges due to a lack of standard collaboration tools. Getting the right information as quickly as possible saves lives, whether this information is about the areas that have been searched or the location of an explosive device. We hope that in addition to increasing public safety, our system will make working conditions safer for law enforcement officers and their canines.},

abstract = {The design of in-vehicle navigation systems fails to take into account the social nature of driving and automobile navigation. In this paper, we consider navigation as a social activity among drivers and navigators to improve design of such systems. We explore the implications of moving from a map-centered, individually-focused design paradigm to one based upon collaborative human interaction during the navigation task. We conducted a qualitative interaction design study of navigation among three types of teams: parents and their teenage children, couples, and unacquainted individuals. We found that collaboration varied among these different teams, and was influenced by social role, as well as the task role of driver or navigator. We also found that patterns of prompts, maneuvers, and confirmations varied among the three teams. We identify overarching practices that differ greatly from the literature on individual navigation. From these discoveries, we present design implications that can be used to inform future navigation systems.},

A critical problem in a crisis situation is how to efficiently discover, collect, organize, search and disseminate real-time disaster information. In this paper, we address several key problems which inhibit better information sharing and collaboration between both private and public sector participants for disaster management and recovery. We design and implement a web based prototype implementation of a Business Continuity Information Network (BCIN) system utilizing the latest advances in data mining technologies to create a user-friendly, Internet-based, information-rich service and acting as a vital part of a company's business continuity process. Specifically, information extraction is used to integrate the input data from different sources; the content recommendation engine and the report summarization module provide users personalized and brief views of the disaster information; the community generation module develops spatial clustering techniques to help users build dynamic community in disasters. Currently, BCIN has been exercised at Miami-Dade County Emergency Management.},

Although machine learning (ML) can help classify matches into different occurrence categories, designers demand more flexible input, interpretable output, and interactive collaboration with ML to facilitate analysis in breadth and depth. To this end, we work closely with a game company to design a visual occurrence analytics system through a stepwise co-design process. We first identify bottlenecks in game designers' conventional practices and their concerns about ML via an observational study. Then, we develop the single-match module of the visualization system to familiarize users with interactive analytics. Next, we incorporate ML models to recommend match segments of interest during occurrence classification and streamline the cross-match analysis. Empirical studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our stepwise co-design process indeed helps them better embrace collaboration with machines.},

abstract = {Manycore processors, with tens to hundreds of tiny cores but no hardware-based cache coherence, can offer tremendous peak throughput on highly parallel programs while being complexity and energy efficient. Manycore processors can be combined with a few high-performance big cores for executing operating systems, legacy code, and serial regions. These systems use heterogeneous cache coherence (HCC) with hardware-based cache coherence between big cores and software-centric cache coherence between tiny cores. Unfortunately, programming these heterogeneous cache-coherent systems to enable collaborative execution is challenging, especially when considering dynamic task parallelism. This paper seeks to address this challenge using a combination of light-weight software and hardware techniques. We provide a detailed description of how to implement a work-stealing runtime to enable dynamic task parallelism on heterogeneous cache-coherent systems. We also propose direct task stealing (DTS), a new technique based on user-level interrupts to bypass the memory system and thus improve the performance and energy efficiency of work stealing. Our results demonstrate that executing dynamic task-parallel applications on a 64-core system (4 big, 60 tiny) with complexity-effective HCC and DTS can achieve: 7x speedup over a single big core; 1.4x speedup over an area-equivalent eight big-core system with hardware-based cache coherence; and 21% better performance and similar energy efficiency compared to a 64-core system (4 big, 60 tiny) with full-system hardware-based cache coherence.},

abstract = {Early Modern emblems combined text and image. Though there were many variants, the archetypical emblem literary form (mid-sixteenth through mid-eighteenth centuries) consisted of an image (the pictura), a text inscription (the inscriptio), and a text epigram (the subscriptio), the last usually in verse. Digitized emblem literature poses interesting challenges as regards content and metadata granularity, the use of interdisciplinary controlled vocabularies, and the need to present digitized primary sources in a complex network of associated sources, derivatives, and contemporaneous context. In this paper, we describe a digital library Web application designed to better support the ways emblem scholars search for and use digitized emblem books, focusing on metadata design, issues of resource granularity and identification, and the use of Linked Data Web services for Iconclass, a multilingual classification system for cultural heritage art and images. Outcomes to date, achieved by emblem scholars and librarians working in collaboration, provide a case study for multi-faceted, interactive approaches to curating mixed text-image digital resources and the use of Linked Data vocabulary services. Lessons learned highlight the value of librarian-scholar collaboration and help to illustrate why digital libraries need to move beyond merely disseminating digitized book surrogates.},

abstract = {Category systems have traditionally been created by small committees of people who had authority over the system they were designing. With the rise of large-scale social media systems, category schemes are being created by groups with differing perspectives, values, and expectations for how categories will be used. Prior studies of social tagging and folksonomy focused on the application and evolution of the collective category scheme, but struggled to uncover some of the collective rationale undergirding the decision-making processes in those schemes. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze the early discussions among editors of Wikipedia about the design and creation of its category system. We highlight three themes that dominated the discussion: hierarchy, scope and navigation, and relate these themes to their more formal roots in the information science literature. We distill out four styles of collaboration with regard to category systems that apply broadly to social tagging and other folksonomies. We conclude the paper with implications for collaborative tools and category systems as applied to large-scale collaborative systems.},

Leading this will be a vast expansion in heterogeneous end-points to a new wireless internet, moving IP throughout the physical world. Billions of internet connected cell phones, embedded processors, hand held devices, sensors, and actuators will lead to radical new applications in biomedicine,transportation, environmental monitoring, and interpersonal communication and collaboration. The combination of wireless LANs, the third generation of cellular phones, satellites, and the increasing use of the FCC unlicensed wireless band will cover the world with connectivity. The resulting vast increase in data streams, augmented by the advent of ass market broadband to homes and businesses, will drive the backbone of the internet to a pure optical lambda-switched network of tremendous capacity.

People with similar interest but different skill-sets have the chance to meet and collaborate to create prototypes of games together, whether digital or analog. In this explorative study, data from the GGJ website across four years of game jams and their participants are analyzed, towards investigating group interaction and group forming behavior. The focus is on using social network analysis and social metrics to evaluate the influence of a) jammer skillset and b) jam locations, on social and communicative structures among game jammers in the GGJ environment. The findings suggest that different skill-sets support different forms of social structures and also setups in countries refer to different group sizes and different social structures.},

abstract = {Web services technology is prevailing for business-to- business integration due to its well defined infrastructure enabling interoperability among heterogeneous applications. However, this interoperability promise also poses a difficulty in building a Web service management framework which can work across organizational boundaries. In this paper, we argue that existing Web service management systems are inflexible in the way they handle QoS violations of a composite service.We suggest to use an intermediate step, called QoS conflict mediation, to make existing Web service management systems more flexible. Our mediation approach is based on a combination of two new ideas. Firstly, we propose to use techniques from the AI field of Distributed Constraint Satisfaction to intelligently mediate any QoS conflicts between services in compositions involving multiple service providers. Secondly, we propose a novel monitoring system, based on cryptography, to verify the conformance of service providers to the specification of a selected DisCSP algorithm - the Asysnchronous Aggregate Search (AAS). This enables our DisCSP based QoS mediation to be used in the real Web services environment where full collaboration between providers may not always be guaranteed.},

Due to the local computing capacity, resource scheduling algorithms for large-scale file requests often have higher response delay and lower scheduling efficiency. In this paper, a priority based maximum revenue vehicle cloud computing resource scheduling algorithm is proposed. This algorithm uses an improved dynamic greedy algorithm to establish the system revenue model of the device in the scene. The algorithm considers the priority of vehicle requests, the amount of request data, and the user allowed time and other factors to maximize the revenue. The simulation results show that the algorithm can obtain the optimal resource allocation of vehicle collaboration by changing different parameter settings, and has good practicability and feasibility.},

Social interactions is captured using Sociometric badges [17] and are visualized on mobile phones to promote behavioral change. Particularly in distributed collaborations, MM attempts to bridge the gap among the distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level without distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and measure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effectively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral difference between dominant and non-dominant people. Our system encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve interactions across various group collaboration contexts.},

abstract = {The need for increased performance per watt, coupled with the demands of processing diverse workloads, has triggered an industry shift towards heterogeneous computing systems. Integration of high-performance CPUs with energy-efficient GPUs is now common in HPC. Architectural heterogeneity has also permeated other domains such as mobile processing, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things. Machine learning practitioners routinely use accelerators in both training and inference. The move towards heterogeneity presents a significant educational challenge since few current curricula include much about heterogeneous computing except possibly in upper-division electives. The NSF-funded initiative ToUCH: Teaching Undergraduates Collaborative and Heterogeneous computing was conceived to confront this impending challenge (https://touch.cs.txstate.edu). The ToUCH project has several ongoing initiatives to promote and encourage teaching of heterogeneous computing. These include summer bootcamps, faculty training workshops and the design, implementation, and integration of a collection of teaching modules on heterogenous computing. In this workshop, we present modules from the ToUCH repository to incorporate heterogeneous computing into core CS courses taken by all majors (e.g., CS 1, CS 2, Computer Organization, Operating Systems). Attendees will have time to work through lab exercises, assignments and tutorials associated with the modules while we assist. We will provide post-workshop support for instructors interested in adopting the modules. In addition, we will solicit feedback from them to help guide our future module development.},

abstract = {Communication and collaboration is a major challenge for large-scale software development. Cognitive and psychological distance between individuals and teams affect this collaboration and can cause communications gaps. We propose a novel method for assessing distance between teams, and explore potential explanations for these distances. In an exploratory case study of the quality assurance department at Axis Communications, we used interactive posters to collect data and obtained a 52% response rate from the 175 test engineers. We identified low psychological distance as an indicator of a company culture with open and frequent communication, and of a team with good social networking skills and well-functioning points of contact. We found that low cognitive distance is an indicator of differences regarding the responsibilities of a team; within the same system and between different types of systems. We also found correlations between psychological and cognitive distance. Large organisations may apply our concept to assess distance between teams, and our finding can be useful in interpreting these distances. Furthermore, our results provide a basis for further research on how the concept of distances can be used to assess collaboration within large organisations.},

We elaborate this link with an empirical study of AI in the context of decision-making in a street-level bureaucracy: job placement. The study examines caseworkers' perspectives on the use of AI, and contributes to an understanding of bureaucratic decision-making, with implications for integrating AI in caseworker systems. We report findings from a participatory workshop on AI with 35 caseworkers from different types of public services, followed up by interviews with five caseworkers specializing in job placement. The paper contributes an understanding of caseworkers' collaboration around documentation as a key aspect of bureaucratic decision-making practices. The collaborative aspects of casework are important to show because they are subject to process descriptions making case documentation prone for an individually focused AI with consequences for the future of how casework develops as a practice. Examining the collaborative aspects of caseworkers' documentation practices in the context of AI and (potentially) automation, our data show that caseworkers perceive AI as valuable when it can support their work towards management, (strengthen their cause, if a case requires extra resources), and towards unemployed individuals (strengthen their cause in relation to the individual's case when deciding on, and assigning a specific job placement program). We end by discussing steps to support cooperative aspects in AI decision-support systems that are increasingly implemented into the bureaucratic context of public services.},

abstract = {Socially interactive artificial agents are no longer mere fiction. For many, they are already part of everyday life. Due to technical advances in multimodal behavior analysis and synthesis, the asymmetry of communication between machines and humans is dissolving. Consequently, the interaction with robots and virtual characters has become more intuitive and natural, particularly for everyday users. Nevertheless, there is still some work to be done until artificial agents are able to smoothly interact with people over more extended periods in their homes and to cope with unforeseen situations. In my talk, I will recall my journey into the field of socially interactive Artificial Intelligence starting in the 90ies with the development of the Personalized Plan-Based Presenter (in short, the PPP Persona [1]). This cartoon character explained technical devices to users by combining speech, gestures, and facial expressions. We quickly realized that we had to equip such characters with a certain amount of social and emotional intelligence to keep users engaged over a more extended period. Furthermore, it became clear that creating such agents is not a job that can be done by computer scientists alone. In collaboration with social and medical sciences, dramaturgy, and media art colleagues, we developed a wide range of applications with socially interactive characters or robots over the past years, including art and entertainment [2], cultural training [5]and social coaching [3], and more recently, personal wellbeing and health [4]. In my talk, I will describe various computational methods to implement socially interactive behaviors in artificial agents. Besides analytic methods informed by theories from the cognitive and social sciences, I will discuss empirical approaches that enable an artificial agent to learn socially interactive behaviors from recordings of human-human interactions or life interactions with human interlocutors. I will highlight opportunities and challenges that arise from neural behavior generation approaches that promise to achieve the next level of human-likeness in virtual agents and social robots. Finally, I will share lessons we learnt during the development of socially interactive agents. To benefit users, we do not just have to work on technical solutions, but go beyond disciplinary boundaries to encompass ethical, legal, and social implications of employing such agents.},

In scenarios of distributed collaboration on datasets it is necessary to provide support for multiple different versions of datasets to exist simultaneously, while also providing support for merging diverged datasets. In this paper we present an approach that uses SPARQL 1.1 in combination with the version control system Git, that creates commits for all changes applied to an RDF dataset containing multiple named graphs. Further the operations provided by Git are used to distribute the commits among collaborators and merge diverged versions of the dataset. We show the advantages of (public) Git repositories for RDF datasets and how this represents a way to collaborate on RDF data and consume it. With SPARQL 1.1 and Git in combination, users are given several opportunities to participate in the evolution of RDF data.},

abstract = {To overcome the limitations of current technologies for remote collaboration, we propose a system that changes a video feed based on task properties, people's actions, and message properties. First, we examined how participants manage different visual resources in a laboratory experiment using a collaborative task in which one partner (the helper) instructs another (the worker) how to assemble online puzzles. We analyzed helpers' eye gaze as a function of the aforementioned parameters. Helpers gazed at the set of alternative pieces more frequently when it was harder for workers to differentiate these pieces, and less frequently over repeated trials. The results further suggest that a helper's desired focus of attention can be predicted based on task properties, his/her partner's actions, and message properties. We propose a conditional Markov model classifier to explore the feasibility of predicting gaze based on these properties. The accuracy of the model ranged from 65.40% for puzzles with easy-to-name pieces to 74.25% for puzzles with more difficult to name pieces. The results suggest that we can use our model to automatically manipulate video feeds to show what helpers want to see when they want to see it.},

Although analysing scientific collaborations is a well-established subject in scientometrics, evaluations of scientific collaborations within a country remains speculative with studies based on a limited number of fields or using data too inadequate to be representative of collaborations at a national level. This study represents a unique view on the collaborative aspect of scientific activities in New Zealand.We perform a quantitative study based on all Scopus publications in all subjects for more than 1500 New Zealand institutions over a period of 6 years to generates an extensive mapping of scientific collaboration at a national level. The comparative results reveal the level of collaboration between New Zealand institutions and business enterprises, government institutions, higher education providers, and private not for profit organisations in 2010-2015.Constructing a collaboration network of institutions, we observe a power-law distribution indicating that a small number of New Zealand institutions account for a large proportion of national collaborations. Network centrality concepts are deployed to identify the most central institutions of the country in terms of collaboration. We also provide comparative results on 15 universities and Crown research institutes based on 27 subject classifications.},

abstract = {In most BPM systems (a.k.a. workflow systems), the data for process execution is scattered across databases for enterprise, auxiliary local data stores within the BPM systems, and even file systems (e.g., specification of process models). The interleaving nature of data management and BP execution and the lack of a coherent conceptual data model for all data needed for execution make it hard for (1) providing Business-Process-as-a-Service (BPaaS) and (2) effective support for collaboration between business processes. The primary reason is that an enormous effort is required for maintaining both the engines and the data for the client applications. In particular, different modeling languages and different BPM systems make process interoperation one of the toughest challenges. In this article, we formulate a concept of a “universal artifact,” which extends artifact-centric models by capturing all needed data for a process instance throughout its execution. A framework called SeGA based on universal artifacts is developed to support separation of data and BP execution, a key principle for BPM systems. We demonstrate in this article that SeGA is versatile enough to fully facilitate not only executions of individual processes (to support BPaaS) but also various collaboration models. Moreover, SeGA reduces the complexity in runtime management including runtime querying, constraints enforcement, and dynamic modification upon collaboration across possibly different BPM systems.},

A constructive pattern is built to advance some effective measures in knowledge work. Since the focus of the study was on knowledge work-related tasked, there is a possibility that dissimilar evaluations would have arisen if the focus had been on non-knowledge work relevant tasks. This study has gone some way towards enhancing organizations' understanding of the significance of weak ties in knowledge workers' performance.

abstract = {Service Oriented Architecture with underlying technologies like web services and web service orchestration opens new vistas for integration among business processes operating in heterogeneous environments. However, such dynamic collaborations require a highly secure environment at each respective business partner site. Existing web services standards address the issue of security only on the service provider platform. The partner platforms to which sensitive information is released have till now been neglected. Remote Attestation is a relatively new field of research which enables an authorized party to verify that a trusted environment actually exists on a partner platform. To incorporate this novel concept in to the web services realm, a new mechanism called WS-Attestation has been proposed. This mechanism provides a structural paradigm upon which more fine-grained solutions can be built. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Behavioral Attestation for Web Services, in which XACML is built on top of WS-Attestation in order to enable more flexible remote attestation at the web services level. We propose a new type of XACML policy called XACML behavior policy, which defines the expected behavior of a partner platform. Existing web service standards are used to incorporate remote attestation at the web services level and a prototype is presented, which implements XACML behavior policy using low-level attestation techniques.},

abstract = {Information technology enables organizations to improve the quality of services they deliver. Currently, information exchange between public and private organizations is a trend to pursue goals of mutual benefits. However, the heterogeneity of their information systems requires technical solutions to model data and communication and to foster interoperability.Data interoperability allows information sharing and facilitates collaboration between organizations to obtain profits such as the improvement of end-user activities reducing the overload of repeated data and processes, breaking down information silos. Through analyzing a case study, our objective is to focus on information interoperability, and to propose a solution to improve data interoperability among organizations with heterogeneous software applications. Thus, this research work proposes a data interoperability solution with the properties of ensuring semantic consistency and overcoming heterogeneity of information systems. The model is organized in four layers to manage the complexity, the lower layer is designed as a peer-to-peer architecture to support entities autonomy, and as a whole, all layers constitute a middleware solution for the integration of the platforms guaranteeing semantic consistency.},

abstract = {Prompt and accurate detection of system anomalies is essential to ensure the reliability of software systems. Unlike manual efforts that exploit all available run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a single type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make effective use of the joint information among different types of data. Consequently, many false predictions occur. To better understand the manifestations of system anomalies, we conduct a systematical study on a large amount of heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates that logs and metrics can manifest system anomalies collaboratively and complementarily, and neither of them only is sufficient. Thus, integrating heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a system's health status. In this context, we propose Hades, the first end-to-end semi-supervised approach to effectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data. Our approach employs a hierarchical architecture to learn a global representation of the system status by fusing log semantics and metric patterns. It captures discriminative features and meaningful interactions from heterogeneous data via a cross-modal attention module, trained in a semi-supervised manner. We evaluate Hades extensively on large-scale simulated data and datasets from Huawei Cloud. The experimental results present the effectiveness of our model in detecting system anomalies. We also release the code and the annotated dataset for replication and future research.},

abstract = {In recent years, additional information in the side of both users and items are more and more common in the natural world. Traditional recommendation methods mainly utilize the the user-item rating information. These information, if properly used, can benefit to infer the preference of user. But due to the complexity of HIN(heterogeneous information network), HIN based recommendation system is faced with the following challenge: how to properly utilize the attribute of both users and items effectively.To solve such a problem, we propose the approach:coupling collaborative interaction information and semantic information for Top-N Recommendation System(CSRec). For collaborative information,we use graph neural networks to aggregate the neighborhood information. And for semantic information, we use intra-metapath to generate and inter-metapath semantic aggregation between user and item to generate semantic context information. Then we deeply combine two kinds of information and generate recommendation item. Finally, comprensive experiments on three real-world recommendation dataset prove the superiority of our model,in comparison with other baseline models.},

We suggest that the answer to this question is complicated and dependent upon a number of factors, and we propose a research agenda with theoretical bases to guide researchers in the area of virtual team collaboration for the next seven to ten years. While virtual teams are increasingly used by organizations, there has been little systematic research done to understand how collaboration in virtual worlds compares to collaboration supported by other media, or how characteristics of virtual teams influence the collaboration process and outcomes. The research agenda that we propose looks at basic differences between virtual worlds and other media, but also includes consideration of the specific contextual factors, and the influence that leadership might have on the collaboration process and outcomes.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous systems generally consist of a set of devices, services and applications that should interoperate in order to provide context-dependent information to the users. Interoperability requirements are usually fulfilled by establishing shared communication protocols (SOAP, JSON, IIOP, and so on) and connection mechanisms (for instance, Wi-Fi or BlueTooth). Therefore, software solutions in ubiquitous systems trend to be highly bond to specific communication-related technologies, making it increasingly complex to incorporate new communication technologies used by end users who are added to the system. In this paper we present various technology independent models and a platform to overcome this problem by decreasing the level of cohesion between communication technologies and software applications to be developed in heterogeneous ubiquitous systems. In fact, this mobile platform is built by instantiating the proposed models to support the development of collaborative applications on scenarios of mobile forensics.},

abstract = {We exploit recent advances in analysis of graph topology to better understand software evolution, and to construct predictors that facilitate software development and maintenance. Managing an evolving, collaborative software system is a complex and expensive process, which still cannot ensure software reliability. Emerging techniques in graph mining have revolutionized the modeling of many complex systems and processes. We show how we can use a graph-based characterization of a software system to capture its evolution and facilitate development, by helping us estimate bug severity, prioritize refactoring efforts, and predict defect-prone releases. Our work consists of three main thrusts. First, we construct graphs that capture software structure at two different levels: (a) the product, i.e., source code and module level, and (b) the process, i.e., developer collaboration level. We identify a set of graph metrics that capture interesting properties of these graphs. Second, we study the evolution of eleven open source programs, including Firefox, Eclipse, MySQL, over the lifespan of the programs, typically a decade or more. Third, we show how our graph metrics can be used to construct predictors for bug severity, high-maintenance software parts, and failure-prone releases. Our work strongly suggests that using graph topology analysis concepts can open many actionable avenues in software engineering research and practice.},

abstract = {These last five years have seen the generalization of model usage, as their adequation to the design of complex systems began to be more and more understood, and researched. Modeling using specifically tailored models is now common practice. Modeling tools, especially in Eclipse, matured a lot and they are fit for a lot of different contexts and requirements; from the French unemployment office to the NASA. This rising success is not complete yet though, and collaborative modeling is barely taking off, holding back wider adoption.Let's go back all the way to 2006. At that time, during the Eclipse Summit Europe conference, the community at large voices its concerns: there is no available open-source component aiming at comparing and merging models; while such a tool is critical to the success of all modeling-related technologies. Models were becoming more and more central in the development process, their importance rising to the level of the source code's... and yet there was no tool designed to allow teams to work on models collaboratively. It is in light of this observation that we decided to start the EMF Compare project.The challenges were then to be able to compare any kind of model, be it specific or based on a standard, with a good scalability and accuracy of the matching algorithms; and have this comparison integrated with the many different version control management systems available. At that time, there was but a few commercial tools barely starting to provide basic support for collaborative work on models; and the community recognized our commitment in providing a reliable open-source stack.Five years later, both technologies and practices have dramatically evolved. What seemed obvious in 2006 turned out to be but one option among many others, and as time went by we have seen that the original challenges only were a subset of what we were really going to face.This talk will start with the story, from the perspective of an Eclipse commiter and Obeo insider, of what happened during those five past years: how practices and requirements evolved, how our component adapted to these changes and has been used in practice, how we tackled collaborative modeling needs together with our adopters...I will then move on to what is going on right now from the Eclipse side; focusing on how EMF Compare, along with -among others- Mylyn and CDO, are playing a major role in settling the basis of a sound modeling platform supporting collaboration.},

We explore an alternative collaboration paradigm that tackles this imbalance through Parsons problems: students are given fragments of code out of order and tasked with re-organizing them into the correct order. We then create an interdependence between students by assigning each to a different sub-problem in their own space, termed Personal-spaces – they must engage in dialog to negotiate, exchange, and share fragments. In an exploratory study with nine pairs of undergraduate students, we find evidence pointing to affordances of different coordination conditions: Personal-spaces promoted ownership and engagement, while Turn-taking (akin to pair programming) helped maintain a consistent train of thought. Our results provide considerations for design of appropriate problem sets and interfaces to structure collaborative learning.},

The research group of the author has already proposed a 3D software development system called IntelligentBox. IntelligentBox has provided various software components called boxes, which are 3D visible, reactive objects. IntelligentBox allows the user to develop 3D graphics applications by combining already existing boxes through direct manipulations on a computer screen without writing any text-based program. This is the main feature of IntelligentBox, which is a difference from other conventional systems. IntelligentBox also provided a particular box called RoomBox, which enables to build distributed 3D graphics applications. However, RoomBox supported only a mouse device. To develop immersive collaborative virtual environments, IntelligentBox has to support various input and output devices. Then, the author developed such functionalities as new boxes and introduced them into IntelligentBox. The author also extended the functionality of RoomBox in order to treat those new boxes. With these boxes, IntelligentBox came to have the aspects of a development system for immersive collaborative virtual environments.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in almost all domains, from threat recognition to medical diagnosis. Albeit its supreme model accuracy, DL imposes a heavy burden on devices as it incurs overwhelming system overhead to execute DL models, especially on Internet-of-Things (IoT) and edge devices. Collaborative inference is a promising approach to supporting DL models, by which the data owner (the victim) runs the first layers of the model on her local device and then a cloud provider (the adversary) runs the remaining layers of the model. Compared to offloading the entire model to the cloud, the collaborative inference approach is more data privacy-preserving as the owner’s model input is not exposed to outsiders. However, we show in this paper that the adversary can restore the victim’s model input by exploiting the output of the victim’s local model. Our attack is dubbed Ginver 1: Generative model inversion attacks against collaborative inference. Once trained, Ginver can infer the victim’s unseen model inputs without remaking the inversion attack model and thus has the generative capability. We extensively evaluate Ginver under different settings (e.g., white-box and black-box of the victim’s local model) and applications (e.g., CIFAR10 and FaceScrub datasets). The experimental results show that Ginver recovers high-quality images from the victims.},

We present a model of triangulating authoring environments that capture the data underlying these different perspectives, and iteratively sanity-check policy decisions against this information while editing. We also present a tool that consumes instances of the model and automatically generates prototype authoring tools for the described domain.},

abstract = {Distributed computing technology allows software engineering teams to work across different locations and times, collaboratively refining documents or diagrams ultimately producing a single agreed outcome. A natural part of this process is the emergence of differences or conflicts reflecting divergent team member perspectives, interpretations, skills or knowledge. This paper describes CONFER (CONflict Free Editing in a Replicated architecture) a system that address the handling of conflicts in collaborative software development projects. At the technical level, CONFER detects and stores conflicts until they are resolved by user actions. However, it is in the social domain that these user actions are formed and resolved, so effective collaboration tools will need to include support for conflict resolution in the social domain as well.Some software engineering teams will be based on models of cooperation and maintenance of team harmony may require that conflict resolution be based on discussion and consensus, rather than by authority or by simple voting systems. A consensus building approach is proposed based on a method used in travel planning (Chu-Caroll, 2000) that encourages participants to further explore alternatives together with their own proposals. The social support mechanism has been simulated using paper and pen and assessed in a small experiment. The evaluation suggests that the technique is easy to use, reduces conflict resolution time and may be a useful extension to CONFER.},

Implementation of smart and adaptable public transportation is an important challenge in developing cities and newly industrialized economies where growth characteristics contribute to and can be impacted by factors like overcrowding and travel delays. In this paper, we focus on bus transportation, and present the design and implementation of a 3-layer web-based system for performance evaluation and decision support. This is part of a "Smart Cities" initiative, which is an international collaboration between academia and government. The first layer estimates fundamental indicators such as bus travel time and passenger demands by integrating heterogeneous data sources. A novel bus-stop network is then designed in the second layer, which enables the derivation of passenger patterns in public transit using network analysis. The third layer provides decision support by analyzing causal relationships between indicators. The proposed web-based system called SMARTBUS is being developed and validated with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. We believe the use of generally available urban transportation data makes our methodology adaptable and customizable for other cities.},

abstract = {While dependability and security become cornerstones of the information society, they are impaired by change, imprecision, and emerging behavior due to scale, dynamism, and heterogeneity. To address these challenges for next generation Internet computing, key extrafunctional properties should not be an "add on" or an "end to end task" anymore, but rather built in by means of Middleware.Service oriented computing, cloud computing, socio-technical systems, and Web 2.0-style applications are important steps for next generation Internet computing, but still fall short when non functional (a.k.a. extra-functional) quality properties (e.g., dependability, security, performance, and scalability) need to be addressed. The emerging Internet communication architecture (e.g., from projects on the Internet of Things, the Future Internet, etc.) also requires middleware support for delivering computing applications and services. We can see many Internet Computing systems following proprietary end-to-end solutions and being weaved with application-specific approaches. This clearly hinders re-use, which can only be successfully leveraged by Middleware-based solutions. This in turn requires new flexibility for Middleware (adaptivity, elasticity, resilience) and new ways of collaboration between Middleware and applications/services.Therefore, extra-functional quality properties need to be addressed not only by interfacing and communication standards, but also in terms of actual mechanisms, protocols, and algorithms. Some of the challenges are the administrative heterogeneity, the loose coupling between coarsegrained operations and long-running interactions, high dynamism, and the required flexibility during run-time. Recently, massive-scale (e.g., big data, millions of participating parties in different roles) and mobility were added to the crucial challenges for Internet computing middleware. The workshop consequently comprises contributions on how specifically middleware can address the above challenges of next generation Internet computing.},

abstract = {Mingling, the activity of ad-hoc, private, opportunistic conversations ahead of, during, or after breaks, is an important socializing activity for attendees at scheduled events, such as in-person conferences. The Covid-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on the way conferences are organized, so that most of them now take place in a hybrid mode where people can either attend on-site or remotely. While on-site attendees can resume in-person mingling, hybrid modes make it challenging for remote attendees to mingle with on-site peers. In addressing this problem, we propose a collaborative mixed-reality (MR) concept, including a prototype, called HybridMingler. This is a distributed MR system supporting ambient awareness and allowing both on-site and remote conference attendees to virtually mingle. HybridMingler aims to provide both on-site and remote attendees with a spatial sense of co-location in the very same venue location, thus ultimately improving perceived presence.},

Firstly, the edge computing framework based on the functional architecture of industrial Internet is proposed, and the internal and external interaction modes of edge computing node data are specifically sorted out. According to the established data interaction modes, the interactive processing mechanism of cloud-edge collaboration is proposed. Then, according to the logical protocol and physical architecture of active distribution network, the hierarchical architecture model of active distribution network based on edge computing is established to collect, interact and monitor the operating status, operating environment and electricity quantity data of distribution equipment. Finally, based on big data technology, the typical application scenarios of edge computing technology in actual power distribution are analyzed, and the efficiency, real-time, security and accuracy of edge computation-based power distribution big data system for local data storage and processing are verified.},

abstract = {Immersive technologies like eXtended Reality (XR) are the next step in videoconferencing. In this context, understanding the effect of delay on communication is crucial. This article presents the first study on the impact of delay on collaborative tasks using a realistic Social XR system. Specifically, we design an experiment and evaluate the impact of end-to-end delays of 300, 600, 900, 1,200, and 1,500 ms on the execution of a standardized task involving the collaboration of two remote users that meet in a virtual space and construct block-based shapes. To measure the impact of the delay in this communication scenario, objective and subjective data were collected. As objective data, we measured the time required to execute the tasks and computed conversational characteristics by analyzing the recorded audio signals. As subjective data, a questionnaire was prepared and completed by every user to evaluate different factors such as overall quality, perception of delay, annoyance using the system, level of presence, cybersickness, and other subjective factors associated with social interaction. The results show a clear influence of the delay on the perceived quality and a significant negative effect as the delay increases. Specifically, the results indicate that the acceptable threshold for end-to-end delay should not exceed 900 ms. This article additionally provides guidelines for developing standardized XR tasks for assessing interaction in Social XR environments.},

The sophisticated graphical capabilities of modern mobile devices have the potential to distract visitors, a phenomenon known as the heads-down effect. To study the impact of O-UI design on collaboration, a highly-dynamic "complex" O-UI was contrasted against more simplistic, "remote-control" OUI design, in the context of a cancer-treatment simulation. As expected, when groups used the "complex" O-UI, there was less visitor-visitor interaction, but unexpectedly, their conversations were of higher quality. They also engaged in better task division and displayed better task performance. The increased attention "simple" O-UI users were able to devote to monitoring one another's actions seemed to encourage emergent competitive behaviors, which disproportionately affected the engagement of female visitors. "Complex" groups showed no gender-related differences in engagement.},

abstract = {Component-based reuse in mission critical Command and Control system domain was a starting point for a long lasting research collaboration between National University of Singapore (NUS) and ST Electronics Pte. Ltd. (STEE). STEE industrial projects as well as NUS lab studies revealed limitations of conventional architecture-centric, component-based reuse in the area of generic design to unify similarity patterns (e.g., similar classes, components or architectural patterns) commonly found in software. Further research showed that meta-level extensions to conventional techniques could strengthen their generic design capabilities, considerably improving effectiveness of reuse solutions, and increasing productivity gains due to reuse. These experiences led to development of "mixed strategy" approach based on synergistic application of meta-level generative programming technique of XVCL, together with conventional programming techniques. In the paper, we describe university-industry collaboration that proved beneficial for both parties: STEE advanced reuse practice via application of XVCL in several software product line projects. Early inputs from STEE helped NUS team validate and refine XVCL reuse methods, and expand into new research directions. We describe a sequence of projects that led to successful application of XVCL in industrial projects. We describe experiences from those projects and their significance for both industrial practice and understanding principles of flexible software, i.e., software that can be easily changed and adapted to various reuse contexts.},

abstract = {Motivation -- Multi-touch surfaces offer a great potential for collaborative activities due to direct interaction and engaging user experiences. User input is no longer mediated through indirect devices like keyboard or mouse; instead, users can work in parallel or quickly alternate between interacting persons. So far, only standard manipulation gestures for rotating, scaling, and translation have been established as natural interaction with multi-touch devices. In this contribution, novel tools and paradigms to enrich multi-touch interaction are investigated.Research approach -- A workshop setting involving ten students, tutors, and business experts was used, in order to implement novel multi-touch prototypes over the course of two weeks.Findings/Design -- Five case studies have been implemented based on Microsoft® Surface technology, exploiting different levels of manipulation.Research limitations/Implications -- Exhaustive user studies concerning the presented model have not been conducted. Implications of the model are tentatively discussed, suggesting possible study designs for the future.Originality/Value -- Five levels of manipulation are formalized in a model that can be used to design and evaluate cognitive ergonomics of new multi-touch interfaces for collaborative activities.Take away message -- By implementing different levels of manipulation, multi-touch interfaces for collaborative interfaces can be made more powerful and enable users to easily achieve diversified results.},

To address these challenges for next generation Internet computing, key extrafunctional properties should not be an "add on" or an "end to end task" anymore, but rather built in by means of Middleware.Service oriented computing, cloud computing, socio-technical systems, and Web 2.0-style applications are important steps for next generation Internet computing, but still fall short when non functional (a.k.a. extra-functional) quality properties (e.g., dependability, security, performance, and scalability) need to be addressed.

abstract = {Immersive media has the potential for strong impact on users' emotions and their sense of presence and engagement. Increasingly, technology is supporting their involvement by capturing, producing, sharing and accessing information based on their perspectives and experiences, over the Internet, in social media, and through video on demand services using iTV. We have been witnessing an increase in the amount of content and number of devices for capturing, viewing and sensing, many of them portable and offering tremendous opportunities for immersion, user participation and personalization. The integration of different media formats, including 3D content, panoramic displays, multiviews, as well as the possibility of delivering and accessing content through different communication vehicles, promote the development of a new participatory paradigm and enable new perceptual user experiences that provide more realistic and immersive involvement. Immersion may be influenced by sensory modalities, surround effect, and vividness through resolution, and it conveys the user's conscious feeling of being inside the virtual world and the sense of belonging. It has an impact on the users and may be augmented by personalized and context-aware environments and content.The main objective of the Immersive Media Experiences Workshop, held in conjunction with the ACM Multimedia Conference 2013, is to bring together researchers, students, media producers, service providers and industry players in the area of emergent immersive media. The workshop provides a platform for a deep discussion on ongoing work, recent achievements and experiences. It is expected not only to consolidate experiences but also to identify aspects where strong collaboration among all the interested players is needed and to point towards future working directions.This first edition of the workshop attracted high quality submissions from research labs and universities around the world. Many of the papers presented at the workshop were motivated by real-life use cases and concrete application contexts, indicating practical relevance and applicability. These papers cover a broad number of relevant aspects that enable creating immersive experiences, including work in Perceptual Immersion aspects, Participatory and Collaborative approaches, Enabling Technologies and Field Trials in different areas. In addition, the program of the workshop includes one keynote speaker, Dr Adrian D. Cheok, giving a very motivating talk on multisensory approaches using smell and taste.},

The proposed approach is based on Web services and software agent technologies. The aim is to design a flexible and reconfigurable collaborative platform to allow users, on one hand, to collect and manipulate via the Internet different digital media (image, video, audio, 3D models, etc.), and on the other hand, certain services can be manually or dynamically integrated as new behaviours, where existing groupware systems often offer a limited and rigid set of functionalities, hence limiting collaboration's performance. This work is applied on a R&amp;D project, DIGITAL OCEAN, a new media system obtained by the integration of three multimedia products currently being developed, and is conceived to enable the general public to discover, online, underwater virtual environments. We present this ongoing project and the scientific background behind it, taking in consideration technical aspects as well as the project's perspectives on the global market, and emphasizing the innovation it brings, where it opens to the multimedia and audiovisual industries a new space that is still virgin, the underwater space.},

abstract = {This work describes a new Moodle module, CTpractices, developed to give support to the practical content of a basic computer organization course. Within a constructivist pedagocical aproach Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment)[1], a very popular Learning Management Systema (LMS), provides a highly configurable web-based interface that includes a wide range of activities which are, in general, sufficient for a standard course. Nevertheless, when dealing with specific subjects, some functional features are missed, as it is the case when teaching a basic course on computer architecture, an essential topic in the computer science curricula. It involves practical assignments consisting on the design and simulation of elementary processors by means of CAD tools making use of schematic or VHDL design entries.Currently the University of Malaga is making an increasing effort oriented to the successfull implementation of the ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) system. This involves changing the teaching practices carried out traditionally [2], looking towards the developing of assessment mechanisms in order to increase the student?s active effort. In our course, in order to better guide the students, teachers should perform a functional evaluation using a simulation tool to verify whether the students? designs work or not according to the specifications. This is a very time consuming task, becoming a common bottleneck when looking for a continuous assessment of students. One key element of the new CTpractices module is the automatic checking and verification engine that keeps information about the current state of students work, supplying automatic assessment features and feedback to the student. Teachers can modify the project description and define different testing benches. The module stores historical information concerning the results of the different evaluations, extracting statistics and metrics which are very useful when determining the student workload in the context of the ETS model. Additionally, this new module is oriented to promote a collaborative teamwork allowing to define student teams in a more operative way than built-in moodle groups. Other basic aspects supported are material repository, deadlines, hosting, etc.The new module inherits a part of its functionality from a specific LMS previously developed by the authors, that has been in use from academic year 2004 [3], widely proving its usefulness. It has been re-designed according to the Moodle philosophy, making possible to easily extend its application to other similar subjects. The choice for Moodle is motivated by its modular organization based on free software like PHP and MySQL. From the developer point of view, this allows to add new modules using well-known interfaces. As Moodle is currently used by the Virtual Campus of our university, this new module breaks the isolation of the previous platform as refers to activities like forums, messages or event signaling.},

abstract = {An active XML (AXML) document contains tags representing calls to Web services. Therefore, retrieving its contents consists in materializing its data elements by invoking the embedded service calls in a P2P network. In this process, the result of some service calls can be used as input of other calls. Also, usually several peers provide each requested Web service, and peers can collaborate to invoke these services. This often implies a huge search space of many equivalent materialization alternatives, each with different performance. In this paper, we model AXML documents from a workflow perspective and propose a dynamic cost-based optimization strategy to efficiently materialize them, considering the volatility of a typical P2P scenario. Our strategy enables the optimizer, called XCraft, to get more up-to-date information on the status of the peers, and to deliver partial results earlier. Based on a service-oriented algebra of plan operators, we exploit P2P collaboration to delegate both execution and optimization control. Our tests with an XCraft prototype show important performance gains w.r.t. a centralized approach, whilst the optimizer also achieved to drastically reduce the size of the search space.},

abstract = {Emerging three-dimensional (3D) memory technologies, such as the Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), provide high-bandwidth and massive memory-level parallelism. With the growing heterogeneity and complexity of computer systems (CPU cores and accelerators, etc.), efficiently integrating emerging memories into existing systems poses new challenges and requires detailed evaluation in a realistic computing environment. In this article, we propose MEG, an open source, configurable, cycle-exact, and RISC-V-based full-system emulation infrastructure using FPGA and HBM. MEG provides a highly modular hardware design and includes a bootable Linux image for a realistic software flow, so that users can perform cross-layer software-hardware co-optimization in a full-system environment. To improve the observability and debuggability of the system, MEG also provides a flexible performance monitoring scheme to guide the performance optimization. The proposed MEG infrastructure can potentially benefit broad communities across computer architecture, system software, and application software. Leveraging MEG, we present two cross-layer system optimizations as illustrative cases to demonstrate the usability of MEG. In the first case study, we present a reconfigurable memory controller to improve the address mapping of standard memory controller. This reconfigurable memory controller along with its OS support allows us to optimize the address mapping scheme to fully exploit the massive parallelism provided by the emerging three-dimensional (3D) memories. In the second case study, we present a lightweight IOMMU design to tackle the unique challenges brought by 3D memory in providing virtual memory support for near-memory accelerators. We provide a prototype implementation of MEG on a Xilinx VU37P FPGA and demonstrate its capability, fidelity, and flexibility on real-world benchmark applications. We hope MEG fills a gap in the space of publicly available FPGA-based full-system emulation infrastructures, specifically targeting memory systems, and inspires further collaborative software/hardware innovations.},

abstract = {This study introduces a methodology to investigate students’ collaborative behaviors as they work in pairs to build computational models of scientific processes. We expand the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework—specifically, Planning, Enacting, and Reflection—proposed in the literature, applying it to examine students’ collaborative problem-solving (CPS) behaviors in a computational modeling task. We analyze these behaviors by employing a Markov Chain (MC) modeling approach that scrutinizes students’ model construction and model debugging behaviors during CPS. This involves interpreting their actions in the system collected through computer logs and analyzing their conversations using a Large Language Model (LLM) as they progress through their modeling task in segments. Our analytical framework assesses the behaviors of high- and low-performing students by evaluating their proficiency in completing the specified computational model for a kinematics problem. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining Markov Chain analysis of student problem-solving transitions with qualitative interpretations of their conversation segments. The results highlight distinct differences in behaviors between high- and low-performing groups, suggesting potential for developing adaptive scaffolds in future work to enhance support for students in collaborative problem-solving.},

abstract = {User interface design consists of a collaborative activity where various stakeholders can all sketch the future interactive system at different levels of fidelity on different devices and computing platforms. User interfaces sketches are also intended to support prototypes on multiple computing platforms and operating systems that all impose their own capabilities and constraints. In order to support the needs for user interface design by sketching, this paper describes Gambit, a multi-platform system that provides a light-weight approach for prototyping graphical user interfaces by sketching with HTML5. The paper reports on an experiment for the most preferred platform/devices for three primary sketching functions by designers and developers in a Gambit-supported session.},

abstract = {The SeMap project, funded by the BBVA Foundation, has among its main objectives, to provide semantics to digitised heritage objects, and to make this information more accessible through web visualisation systems that use spatio-temporal maps. This project has had the collaboration and support of the Ministry of Culture and Sport of the Spanish Government, through CERES, the Digital Network of Museum Collections in Spain. This network manages data related to more than 400,000 objects, located in 113 museums of different specialities and from various thematic and geographical areas. These data are currently accessible through a web portal, but there is no public access to a knowledge graph with this information. Thanks to the collaboration of this entity, SeMap granted the access to this information. With the adequate process, this data has been represented by a knowledge graph. Using the resources offered by the Google Maps and Geonames APIs, it has been possible to georeferenced the data with an acceptable level of precision. This fact, has allowed the design and development of a spatio-temporal map visualisation system with a high level of interaction. This paper describes the process of creating a knowledge graph with this information, based on the CIDOC-CRM model, and using the CERES Cultural Heritage vocabularies and thesauri. The technologies and techniques used to visualise its contents are also described. Finally, the results of the evaluation of the project with end users are presented. In order to evaluate the project, an evaluation session based on the System Usability Scale (SUS) has been conducted. Forty-five secondary school students participated in this session, accessing the tool from the classroom and with the devices with which they usually work.},

abstract = {A social tagging system provides users an effective way to collaboratively annotate and organize items with their own tags. A social tagging system contains heterogeneous information like users' tagging behaviors, social networks, tag semantics and item profiles. All the heterogeneous information helps alleviate the cold start problem due to data sparsity. In this paper, we model a social tagging system as a multi-type graph. To learn the weights of different types of nodes and edges, we propose an optimization framework, called OptRank. OptRank can be characterized as follows:(1) Edges and nodes are represented by features. Different types of edges and nodes have different set of features. (2) OptRank learns the best feature weights by maximizing the average AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of the tag recommender. We conducted experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., Delicious and Last.fm. Experimental results show that: (1) OptRank outperforms the existing graph based methods when only (user, tag, item) relation is available. (2) OptRank successfully improves the results by incorporating social network, tag semantics and item profiles.},

Different types of Perceptual Logic are found to influence the perceived affordances of an artwork. We present a computational collaborative art program called PERLOGICART that uses a computational model of Perceptual Logic to learn an artist's style through collaboration. The research is conducted using a practice-based method --- we are working on building an interactive tool to support the making of artworks and the understanding of the creative process at the same time. PERLOGICART is a compelling interactive artwork as well as a valuable research tool that records and categorizes the creative process in a systematic manner.},

abstract = {Scientific data are posing new challenges to data management due to the large volume, complexity and heterogeneity of the data. Meanwhile, scientific collaboration becomes increasingly important, which relies on integrating and sharing data from distributed institutions. In this demo, we present SciPort, a Web-based platform on supporting scientific data management and integration based on peer-to-peer architectures, where researchers can easily collect, publish, and share their complex scientific data across multi-institutions. SciPort provides a general metadata based data model to capture the context description of experiments and link experiment data into comprehensive metadata documents, and supports a hierarchical organization of the overall data space for data browsing. SciPort takes two alternative "peer"-to-"peer" (or peer-database-to-peer-database) based approaches to integrate scientific data: pure peer-to-peer architecture and central server based peer-to-peer architecture. The later provides a virtual view of all published data from multiple local sites and supports complex queries with XQuery. The system provides a unified framework for adaptable architectures and customizable schemas, and supplies comprehensive tool set to manage and share scientific data. SciPort was first prototyped in Siemens Corporate Research, and now becomes a mature product and has been successfully used in both biomedical research and clinical trials for scientific research communities.},

While tools for DML (especially FL) are starting to flourish, many are not flexible and portable enough to experiment with novel processors (e.g., RISC-V), non-fully connected network topologies, and asynchronous collaboration schemes. We overcome these limitations via a domain-specific language allowing us to map DML schemes to an underlying middleware, i.e. the FastFlow parallel programming library. We experiment with it by generating different working DML schemes on x86-64 and ARM platforms and an emerging RISC-V one. We characterise the performance and energy efficiency of the presented schemes and systems. As a byproduct, we introduce a RISC-V porting of the PyTorch framework, the first publicly available to our knowledge.},

abstract = {Moore's Law and the drive towards performance efficiency have led to the on-chip integration of general-purpose cores with special-purpose accelerators. Pangaea is a heterogeneous CMP design for non-rendering workloads that integrates IA32 CPU cores with non-IA32 GPU-class multi-cores, extending the current state-of-the-art CPU-GPU integration that physically "fuses" existing CPU and GPU designs. Pangaea introduces (1) a resource repartitioning of the GPU, where the hardware budget dedicated for 3D-specific graphics processing is used to build more general-purpose GPU cores, and (2) a 3-instruction extension to the IA32 ISA that supports tighter architectural integration and fine-grain shared memory collaborative multithreading between the IA32 CPU cores and the non-IA32 GPU cores. We implement Pangaea and the current CPU-GPU designs in fully-functional synthesizable RTL based on the production quality RTL of an IA32 CPU and an Intel GMA X4500 GPU. On a 65 nm ASIC process technology, the legacy graphics-specific fixed-function hardware has the area of 9 GPU cores and total power consumption of 5 GPU cores. With the ISA extensions, the latency from the time an IA32 core spawns a GPU thread to the time the thread begins execution is reduced from thousands of cycles to fewer than 30 cycles. Pangaea is synthesized on a FPGA-based prototype and runs off-the-shelf IA32 OSes. A set of general-purpose non-graphics workloads demonstrate speedups of up to 8.8x.},

abstract = {When new users join social networking websites, they often form collaboration ties with existing users, which in turn may result in some level of activity on the site. However, for various reasons, new users often fail to create such ties and their contributions to the system's overall activity remain insignificant. For example, on Question and Answering portals, such as the StackExchange network, users collaborate to find the best answers for a given set of questions. However, the intentions of new users are highly diverse. While the contributions of most users positively impact the evolution of a community, other participants might just try to steer discussions off-topic or purposely generate discord. To better understand such malicious behavior, it is important to model and quantify the impact of such users on the overall activity in collaboration networks. In this paper we simulate and investigate the influence of trolls---users who intentionally contribute detrimental content---on the total activity of several different StackExchange instances, Semantic MediaWikis and Subreddits. The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we simulate activity dynamics in the context of trolls in online collaboration networks. Second, we analyze and quantify the impact of trolls on the levels of activity in these networks. Third, we discuss our results and put them into a real-world context.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging is a field that benefits from distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs) to perform data processing and analysis, which is often achieved using grid workflow systems. Collaborative research in neuroimaging requires ways to facilitate exchange between different groups, in particular to enable sharing, re-use and interoperability of applications implemented as workflows. The SHIWA project provides solutions to facilitate sharing and exchange of workflows between workflow systems and DCI resources. In this paper we present and analyse how the SHIWA platform was used to implement various usage scenarios in which workflow exchange supports collaboration in neuroscience. The SHIWA platform and the implemented solutions are described and analysed from the "user" perspective, in this case the workflow developers and the neuroscientists. We conclude that the platform in its current form is valuable for the foreseen usage scenarios, and we identify remaining challenges concerning management of multiple credentials and data transfers across DCIs.},

Collaboration Recommendation Systems (CRSs) have been developed to help researchers identify possible collaboration partners, but they often rely on citation graphs or paper abstracts which may not be readily available in organizational databases or online sources. However, scientific publication titles provide consistent bibliometric data that can provide insights into research areas. TOMOSCO is a topic modelling framework that uses transformer-based methods to extract research area information from small amounts of text, such as publication titles or brief project descriptions. TOMOSCO can classify, cluster, and match research topics across different disciplines, uncovering relationships among scientists and suggesting potential interdisciplinary collaborations. In experiments, TOMOSCO was able to identify existing collaborations with over 90% accuracy based solely on publication titles and propose new collaborations based on previously unseen publications and project descriptions.},

abstract = {News recommendation is essential for personalized news distribution. Federated news recommendation, which enables collaborative model learning from multiple clients without sharing their raw data, is a promising approach for preserving users' privacy. However, the security of federated news recommendation is still unclear. In this paper, we study this problem by proposing an untargeted attack on federated news recommendation called UA-FedRec. By exploiting the prior knowledge of news recommendation and federated learning, UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the model performance with a small percentage of malicious clients. First, the effectiveness of news recommendation highly depends on user modeling and news modeling. We design a news similarity perturbation method to make representations of similar news farther and those of dissimilar news closer to interrupt news modeling, and propose a user model perturbation method to make malicious user updates in opposite directions of benign updates to interrupt user modeling. Second, updates from different clients are typically aggregated with a weighted average based on their sample sizes. We propose a quantity perturbation method to enlarge sample sizes of malicious clients in a reasonable range to amplify the impact of malicious updates. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that UA-FedRec can effectively degrade the accuracy of existing federated news recommendation methods, even when defense is applied. Our study reveals a critical security issue in existing federated news recommendation systems and calls for research efforts to address the issue.

Starting in 1998 in Glasgow, MobileHCI is now on its 12th edition and it is the leading conference in the field of Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services. The MobileHCI series provides a forum for academics and practitioners to discuss the challenges and potential solutions for effective interaction with mobile systems and services. It covers the design, evaluation and application of techniques and approaches for mobile and wearable computing devices and services.MobileHCI 2010 call for papers attracted many researchers and practitioners in the area receiving a total of 111 full papers and 114 short papers. Through a very thorough review process, we were able to accept 26 full papers and 20 short papers in a very competitive process. The acceptance rate for full papers was 23.4% and for short papers was 17.5%. In addition to the full and short papers, MobileHCI 2010 includes other submission categories that promote different types of interactions among the participants (workshops, panels, industrial case studies, a design competition, future innovations, posters, demos and experiences, and a doctoral consortium).This year, the programme includes three notable invited speakers, Patrick Baudish from the Hasso Plattner Institute, Josh Ulm from Vodafone UK, and Scott Jenson from Google USA, with mixed industry and academic backgrounds sharing their innovative work and experiences with the conference participants.The Programme Committee was fundamental in reaching the final high quality programme. As a new approach, the rigorous review process included Associate Chairs and Programme Committee members. Each paper was reviewed by at least three PC members (most of the papers by four or five) and was assigned to an Associate Chair that moderated online discussions to reach a final set of reviews for each paper. The Programme Chair and the Associate Chairs met in Lisboa in March 2010 to make the final decisions for the conference. In total, more than 1100 reviews were generated over the several categories of the programme.},

However, there is no systematic empirical study suggesting the underlying relationship between the collaboration network of physicians and its effect on hospital outcomes (i.e., hospitalization cost and readmission rate). In this study, we first propose a way to capture collaboration network among physicians from their visiting information to patients. Then we explore the effect of different attributes (i.e., degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and network density) of physician collaboration network (PCN) on hospital outcomes. Our results show that degree centrality (i.e., level of involvement) and network density (i.e., level of connectedness) of PCN are negatively correlated with hospitalization cost and readmission rate. In contrast, betweenness centrality (i.e., capacity to control the flow of information) is found positively correlated with hospitalization cost and readmission rate. In their respective hospitals, healthcare managers or administrators may follow our research findings to reduce cost and improve quality (i.e., lower readmission rate).},

Geotags bridge the gap between the physical world and the cyberspace, giving rise to new opportunities to extract further insights into user preferences and behaviors. In this article, we aim to exploit geotagged photos from online photo-sharing sites for the purpose of personalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. Owing to the fact that most users have only very limited travel experiences, data sparseness poses a formidable challenge to personalized POI recommendation. To alleviate data sparseness, we propose to augment current collaborative filtering algorithms along from multiple perspectives. Specifically, hybrid preference cues comprising user-uploaded and user-favored photos are harvested to study users’ tastes. Moreover, heterogeneous high-order relationship information is jointly captured from user social networks and POI multimodal contents with hypergraph models. We also build upon the matrix factorization algorithm to integrate the disparate sources of preference and relationship information, and apply our approach to directly optimize user preference rankings. Extensive experiments on a large and publicly accessible dataset well verified the potential of our approach for addressing data sparseness and offering quality recommendations to users, especially for those who have only limited travel experiences.},

abstract = {Professionals and researchers of the Architectural, Engi-neering &amp; Construction (AEC) industry are challenged by the increasing complexity of designing, constructing and op-erating a building. This typically requires close cooperation of actors having different backgrounds and interests. Tra-ditionally, this cooperation happens in an ad-hoc way and information exchange occurs through conventional general-purpose communication channels, such as paper or email. This communication and collaboration process can be inad-equate and inefficient, as it makes room for many different interpretations, mistakes and errors and can eventually lead to schedule and cost alterations. We present Green2.0, a system that tries to leverage advancements in building in-formation modeling to facilitate the collaboration process. The system integrates energy-efficiency simulation tools, and methods for online social network analysis to enable a data-driven approach to building design, construction and operation. By sharing all information online, all project ac-tors can access relevant information when they need so that everyone can work efficient together. The system aims to advance the current state of the art by bringing about a fundamental shift in the way that AEC professionals work together throughout a building's lifecycle.},

abstract = {As deep learning, virtual reality, and other technologies become mature, real-time data processing applications running on intelligent terminals are emerging endlessly; meanwhile, edge computing has developed rapidly and has become a popular research direction in the field of distributed computing. Edge computing network is a network computing environment composed of multi-edge computing nodes and data centers. First, the edge computing framework and key technologies are analyzed to improve the performance of real-time data processing applications. In the system scenario where the collaborative deployment tasks of multi-edge nodes and data centers are considered, the stream processing task deployment process is formally described, and an efficient multi-edge node-computing center collaborative task deployment algorithm is proposed, which solves the problem of copy-free task deployment in the task deployment problem. Furthermore, a heterogeneous edge collaborative storage mechanism with tight coupling of computing and data is proposed, which solves the contradiction between the limited computing and storage capabilities of data and intelligent terminals, thereby improving the performance of data processing applications. Here, a Feasible Solution (FS) algorithm is designed to solve the problem of placing copy-free data processing tasks in the system. The FS algorithm has excellent results once considering the overall coordination. Under light load, the V value is reduced by 73% compared to the Only Data Center-available (ODC) algorithm and 41% compared to the Hash algorithm. Under heavy load, the V value is reduced by 66% compared to the ODC algorithm and 35% compared to the Hash algorithm. The algorithm has achieved good results after considering the overall coordination and cooperation and can more effectively use the bandwidth of edge nodes to transmit and process data stream, so that more tasks can be deployed in edge computing nodes, thereby saving time for data transmission to the data centers. The end-to-end collaborative real-time data processing task scheduling mechanism proposed here can effectively avoid the disadvantages of long waiting times and unable to obtain the required data, which significantly improves the success rate of the task and thus ensures the performance of real-time data processing.},

abstract = {Universal Composition is a promising way to support the long tail of user needs. While most mashup platforms only support single-user scenarios, CRUISE enables the reconfiguration of multi-user mashups during runtime. A major requirement for tool-supported collaboration is the provision of workspace awareness, e. g., about all participants' current activities or rights. With respect to the synchronization of black-box components from different vendors, detecting and representing state changes is far from trivial. To provide adequate workspace awareness, we present an architecture and a widget-based presentation concept. It supports application independent detection of state changes, reusability in different application contexts and flexible reconfigurability during runtime. Thereby, semantic annotations are used to enable component state change replication in case of different underlying DOM representations and provide awareness support in form of semantic activities instead of technical descriptions. The practicability of our prototype, including six widgets, is validated by a user acceptance test.},

Therefore, the improvement of order picking efficiency and the reduction of logistics cost rely on the optimization of order picking in distribution centers. In this paper, a picker-robot collaboration order picking system has been proposed. The human pickers are assigned to different zones, while the automated guided vehicles (AGVs) pick the orders from different zones. To optimize the collaboration scheme, the mathematical model together with a two-stage heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the problems, including order batching, AGV routing and zone scheduling. The case study results have shown the effectiveness and the computation efficiency of the proposed two-stage heuristic algorithm.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate user knowledge collaboration in open innovation communities, specifically focusing on the impact of knowledge exchange behavior on user knowledge output within user knowledge collaboration networks. [Methods] To achieve this objective, we utilize Python web scraping technology to collect user-related data and extract content data from the Huawei Pollen Club. We employ various software packages, including Networkx, NLTK, and Pandas, to perform tasks such as text mining, natural language processing, network construction, and calculation of feature variables relevant to user knowledge collaboration networks. By transforming user interactions and knowledge exchange behavior into measurable indicators, we develop a model to analyze how network characteristics influence user knowledge contribution through knowledge exchange. [Conclusion] The study found that different modes of knowledge exchange can improve the quality of user knowledge contribution, but compared to the breadth of knowledge exchange, the depth of knowledge exchange behavior conducted by users is more beneficial for improving user knowledge contribution. Knowledge exchange depth can increase the recombination of knowledge elements and enhance the user's knowledge system and quality of knowledge contribution, thus being more conducive to improving user knowledge contribution.},

Unlike other technologies supporting science, software can be copied and distributed at essentially no cost, potentially opening the door to unprecedented levels of sharing and collaborative innovation. Yet we do not have a clear picture of how software development for science fits into the day-to-day practice of science, or how well the methods and incentives of its production facilitate realization of this potential. We report the results of a multiple-case study of software development in three fields: high energy physics, structural biology, and microbiology. In each case, we identify a typical publication, and use qualitative methods to explore the production of the software used in the science represented by the publication. We identify several different production systems, characterized primarily by differences in incentive structures. We identify ways in which incentives are matched and mismatched with the needs of the science fields, especially with respect to collaboration.},

Participants and researchers have to be competent, or even experts, in both just to begin to make sense of what is happening. With the growing popularity of peer-production systems, the integration of resources across various platforms is more and more common. The framework of stitching is one analytical stance that has been used to describe the cross-platform work to build and highlight informational and social networks. Through a qualitative study with 32 participants who have different foci on Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, we reveal their practices in three essential stitching processes, production, curation, and dynamic integration. We highlight how their practices enact stitching and extend the conceptual framework to explain barriers that inhibit effective stitching across platforms. We further discuss implications for research in cross-platform work and design to facilitate Wikipedia-Commons collaboration.},

We first elaborate on the requirements for ad-hoc collaborative multi-touch gameplay. As our main contribution, we identified particular gameplay aspects and formalized them in reference to formal elements of gameplay: The game mechanics should support different scopes of involvement and make use of spatial conflicts that relate to the player resources. The game should further offer outcomes that can be achieved in continuous ad-hoc group gameplay. Based on these criteria, we developed the multi-touch game Magic Garden. The case shows, how the defined elements support game creation for ad-hoc collaborative multi-touch play. As a final result, we propose to combine multiple separate mini-games in a mixed scenario as a general approach for the creation of multi-touch games for large public displays.},

abstract = {Sketching is a widely used activity in creative processes. One can argue that we now have Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable of making better drawings and sketches than humans. Some computational drawing applications build upon human input, be it text, an input image, or even a hand-drawn path using the cursor. However, drawing along a present-day computer yields a very different experience from drawing collaboratively with another person. For one, the shared canvas is likely not a physical sheet of paper but rather a screen of some sort. Even with paper-like computer interfaces, the computer mainly draws back virtually, needing no material embodiment to make a drawing. My research investigates human collaboration with computers that draw, specifically focused on the act of sketching. I build exploratory physical systems that allow people to draw and sketch together with a computer. Through my studies, I investigate interaction design to allow for human-computer collaborative sketching. My initial studies with a first experimental platform show that the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm also applies to non-anthropomorphic pen plotters when performing a Tic-Tac-Toe playing task.},
